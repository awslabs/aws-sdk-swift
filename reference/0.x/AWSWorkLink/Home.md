# Protocols

  - [WorkLinkClientProtocol](/aws-sdk-swift/reference/0.x/AWSWorkLink/WorkLinkClientProtocol):
    Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access
    to internal websites and web apps from iOS and Android phones. In a single step, your users, such as
    employees, can access internal websites as efficiently as they access any other public website.
    They enter a URL in their web browser, or choose a link to an internal website in an email. Amazon WorkLink
    authenticates the user's access and securely renders authorized internal web content in a secure
    rendering service in the AWS cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn't download or store any internal web content on
    mobile devices.
