    IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected
    devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services
    cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate with, configure
    rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources
    associated with each device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage
    policies and credentials to authenticate devices.
    The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html">Amazon Web Services IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas.
    You must use the endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to access.
    The service name used by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon Web Services
    Signature Version 4 to sign the request is:
    execute-api.
