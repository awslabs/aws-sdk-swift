/// <p>Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a <code>Filter</code>
///          in your replication configuration, you must also include a
///             <code>DeleteMarkerReplication</code> element. If your <code>Filter</code> includes a
///             <code>Tag</code> element, the <code>DeleteMarkerReplication</code>
///             <code>Status</code> must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating
///          delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config">Basic Rule Configuration</a>. </p>
