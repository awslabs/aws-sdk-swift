/// <p>Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By
///          default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and
///          write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector
///          for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail
///          processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail
///          doesn't log the event.</p>
