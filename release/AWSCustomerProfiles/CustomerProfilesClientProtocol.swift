/// Amazon Connect Customer Profiles Welcome to the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles API Reference. This guide provides information about the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles API, including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas. Amazon Connect Customer Profiles is a unified customer profile for your contact center that has pre-built connectors powered by AppFlow that make it easy to combine customer information from third party applications, such as Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (ITSM), and your enterprise resource planning (ERP), with contact history from your Amazon Connect contact center. If you're new to Amazon Connect , you might find it helpful to also review the [Amazon Connect Administrator Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/what-is-amazon-connect.html).
public protocol CustomerProfilesClientProtocol {

You can create multiple domains, and each domain can have multiple third-party integrations. Each Amazon Connect instance can be associated with only one domain. Multiple Amazon Connect instances can be associated with one domain. Use this API or [UpdateDomain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDomain.html) to enable [identity resolution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_GetMatches.html): set Matching to true. To prevent cross-service impersonation when you call this API, see [Cross-service confused deputy prevention](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention.html) for sample policies that you should apply.

    /// Tests the auto-merging settings of your Identity Resolution Job without merging your data. It randomly selects a sample of matching groups from the existing matching results, and applies the automerging settings that you provided. You can then view the number of profiles in the sample, the number of matches, and the number of profiles identified to be merged. This enables you to evaluate the accuracy of the attributes in your matching list. You can't view which profiles are matched and would be merged. We strongly recommend you use this API to do a dry run of the automerging process before running the Identity Resolution Job. Include at least two matching attributes. If your matching list includes too few attributes (such as only FirstName or only LastName), there may be a large number of matches. This increases the chances of erroneous merges.

    /// This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and subject to change. Before calling this API, use [CreateDomain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDomain.html) or [UpdateDomain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDomain.html) to enable identity resolution: set Matching to true. GetMatches returns potentially matching profiles, based on the results of the latest run of a machine learning process. The process of matching duplicate profiles. If Matching = true, Amazon Connect Customer Profiles starts a weekly batch process called Identity Resolution Job. If you do not specify a date and time for Identity Resolution Job to run, by default it runs every Saturday at 12AM UTC to detect duplicate profiles in your domains. After the Identity Resolution Job completes, use the [GetMatches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_GetMatches.html) API to return and review the results. Or, if you have configured ExportingConfig in the MatchingRequest, you can download the results from S3. Amazon Connect uses the following profile attributes to identify matches:
    ///
    /// * PhoneNumber
    ///
    /// * HomePhoneNumber
    ///
    /// * BusinessPhoneNumber
    ///
    /// * MobilePhoneNumber
