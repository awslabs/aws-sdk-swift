/// <p>Summary information about an AWS Health event.</p>
///          <p>AWS Health events can be public or account-specific:</p>
///          <ul>
///             <li>
///                <p>
///                   <i>Public events</i> might be service events that are not specific
///                to an AWS account. For example, if there is an issue with an AWS Region,
///                AWS Health provides information about the event, even if you don't use services or
///                resources in that Region.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>
///                   <i>Account-specific</i> events are specific to either your AWS
///                account or an account in your organization. For example, if there's an issue with
///                Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud in a Region that you use, AWS Health provides information about the event
///                and the affected resources in the account.</p>
///             </li>
///          </ul>
///          <p>You can determine if an event is public or account-specific by using the
