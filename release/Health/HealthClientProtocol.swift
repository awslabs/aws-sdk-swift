///          <p>The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health information that
///          appears in the <a href="https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/">AWS Personal Health Dashboard</a>. You
///          can use the API operations to get information about AWS Health events that affect your
///          AWS services and resources.</p>
///          <note>
///             <ul>
///                <li>
///                   <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a> to use the
///                   AWS Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account that
///                   doesn't have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a
///                      <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.</p>

///                <li>
///                   <p>You can use the AWS Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to
///                   call the AWS Health API operations. AWS Health supports a multi-Region
///                   application architecture and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive
///                   configuration. You can use the high availability endpoint example to determine
///                   which AWS Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from the
///                   API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html">Accessing the AWS Health API</a> in the

///          <p>If your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS Health organizational

///          identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event or get
///          notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to enable
///          this feature and return event information. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html">Aggregating
