    ///             <b>Linear</b>: For this type, AppConfig processes the
    ///          deployment by dividing the total number of targets by the value specified for <code>Step
    ///             percentage</code>. For example, a linear deployment that uses a <code>Step
    ///             percentage</code> of 10 deploys the configuration to 10 percent of the hosts. After
    ///          those deployments are complete, the system deploys the configuration to the next 10
    ///          percent. This continues until 100% of the targets have successfully received the

    ///             <b>Exponential</b>: For this type, AppConfig processes the
    ///          deployment exponentially using the following formula: <code>G*(2^N)</code>. In this
    ///          formula, <code>G</code> is the growth factor specified by the user and <code>N</code> is
    ///          the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you
    ///          specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as
    ///          follows:</p>
    ///          <p>
    ///             <code>2*(2^0)</code>

    ///          </p>
    ///          <p>Expressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the
