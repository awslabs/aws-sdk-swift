    ///             <b>Linear</b>: For this type, AppConfig processes the
    ///          deployment by increments of the growth factor evenly distributed over the deployment time.
    ///          For example, a linear deployment that uses a growth factor of 20 initially makes the
    ///          configuration available to 20 percent of the targets. After 1/5th of the deployment time
    ///          has passed, the system updates the percentage to 40 percent. This continues until 100% of
    ///          the targets are set to receive the deployed configuration.</p>
    ///
    ///          <p>
    ///             <b>Exponential</b>: For this type, AppConfig processes the
    ///          deployment exponentially using the following formula: <code>G*(2^N)</code>. In this
    ///          formula, <code>G</code> is the growth factor specified by the user and <code>N</code> is
    ///          the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you
    ///          specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as
    ///          follows:</p>
    ///          <p>
    ///             <code>2*(2^0)</code>
    ///          </p>
    ///          <p>
    ///             <code>2*(2^1)</code>
    ///          </p>
    ///          <p>
    ///             <code>2*(2^2)</code>
    ///          </p>
    ///          <p>Expressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the
    ///          targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all
    ///          targets.</p>
