/// Amazon DynamoDB Amazon DynamoDB Streams provides API actions for accessing streams and processing stream records.

You can call DescribeStream at a maximum rate of 10 times per second. Each shard in the stream has a SequenceNumberRange associated with it. If the SequenceNumberRange has a StartingSequenceNumber but no EndingSequenceNumber, then the shard is still open (able to receive more stream records). If both StartingSequenceNumber and EndingSequenceNumber are present, then that shard is closed and can no longer receive more data.

The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading stream records sequentially. If there are no stream records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, GetRecords returns an empty list. Note that it might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains stream records. GetRecords can retrieve a maximum of 1 MB of data or 1000 stream records, whichever comes first.
