/// 			Dockerfile).</p>
/// 		       <p>You can view the health status of both individual containers and a task with the
/// 			DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in the console.</p>
/// 		       <p>The following describes the possible <code>healthStatus</code> values for a

///          </ul>
/// 		       <p>The following describes the possible <code>healthStatus</code> values for a task. The

/// 		       <ul>
///             <li>
/// 				           <p>

/// 			         </li>
///          </ul>
/// 		       <p>If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue its
/// 			lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of a service, if the

/// 		       <ul>
///             <li>
/// 				           <p>Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon ECS

/// 			         </li>
///             <li>
