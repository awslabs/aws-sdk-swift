/// <p>AWS OpsWorks Stacks supports five
///       lifecycle events:
///         <b>setup</b>, <b>configuration</b>, <b>deploy</b>, <b>undeploy</b>, and <b>shutdown</b>. For
///       each layer, AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs a set of standard recipes for each event. In addition, you can provide
///       custom recipes for any or all layers and events. AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs custom event recipes after the
///       standard recipes. <code>LayerCustomRecipes</code> specifies the custom recipes for a
///       particular layer to be run in response to each of the five events. </p>
///
///          <p>To specify a recipe, use the cookbook's directory name in the repository followed by two colons and the recipe name, which is the recipe's file name without the .rb extension. For example: phpapp2::dbsetup specifies the dbsetup.rb recipe in the repository's phpapp2 folder.</p>
