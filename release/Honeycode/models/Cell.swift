    ///             will have it's raw value as "1.325" and formatted value as "1.33". A currency value for

    ///             decimal places in the format will have its raw value as "0.2" and the formatted value as "20.00%". An
    ///             accounting value of -$25 will have "-25" as the raw value and "$  (25.00)" as the formatted value.
    ///         </p>
    ///         <p>
    ///             Cells with format TEXT will have the raw text as the raw value. For example, a cell with text "John Smith"

    ///         </p>
    ///         <p>
    ///             Cells with format CONTACT will have the name of the contact as a formatted value and the email address of
    ///             the contact as the raw value. For example, a contact for John Smith will have "John Smith" as the
    ///             formatted value and "john.smith@example.com" as the raw value.
