A domain consists of an associated Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume, a list of authorized users, and a variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations. An Amazon Web Services account is limited to one domain per region. Users within a domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other. EFS storage When a domain is created, an EFS volume is created for use by all of the users within the domain. Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS volume for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files. SageMaker uses the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) to encrypt the EFS volume attached to the domain with an Amazon Web Services managed key by default. For more control, you can specify a customer managed key. For more information, see [Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/encryption-at-rest.html). VPC configuration All SageMaker Studio traffic between the domain and the EFS volume is through the specified VPC and subnets. For other Studio traffic, you can specify the AppNetworkAccessType parameter. AppNetworkAccessType corresponds to the network access type that you choose when you onboard to Studio. The following options are available:

    /// Creates an endpoint using the endpoint configuration specified in the request. Amazon SageMaker uses the endpoint to provision resources and deploy models. You create the endpoint configuration with the [CreateEndpointConfig] API. Use this API to deploy models using Amazon SageMaker hosting services. For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to Amazon SageMaker hosting services, see the [Create Endpoint example notebook.](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/sagemaker-fundamentals/create-endpoint/create_endpoint.ipynb) You must not delete an EndpointConfig that is in use by an endpoint that is live or while the UpdateEndpoint or CreateEndpoint operations are being performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new EndpointConfig. The endpoint name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in your Amazon Web Services account. When it receives the request, Amazon SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them. When you call [CreateEndpoint], a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting [Eventually Consistent Reads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html), the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB, this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call [DescribeEndpointConfig] before calling [CreateEndpoint] to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read. When Amazon SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to Creating. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to InService. Amazon SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the [DescribeEndpoint] API. If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, Amazon SageMaker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. Amazon Web Services STS is activated in your IAM user account by default. If you previously deactivated Amazon Web Services STS for a region, you need to reactivate Amazon Web Services STS for that region. For more information, see [Activating and Deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide. To add the IAM role policies for using this API operation, go to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), and choose Roles in the left navigation pane. Search the IAM role that you want to grant access to use the [CreateEndpoint] and [CreateEndpointConfig] API operations, add the following policies to the role.

Then you call the [CreateEndpoint] API. Use this API if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services to deploy models into production. In the request, you define a ProductionVariant, for each model that you want to deploy. Each ProductionVariant parameter also describes the resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to provision. This includes the number and type of ML compute instances to deploy. If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a VariantWeight to specify how much traffic you want to allocate to each model. For example, suppose that you want to host two models, A and B, and you assign traffic weight 2 for model A and 1 for model B. Amazon SageMaker distributes two-thirds of the traffic to Model A, and one-third to model B. When you call [CreateEndpoint], a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists.

When you use SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker Python SDK, all experiments, trials, and trial components are automatically tracked, logged, and indexed.

    /// You can also use automated data labeling to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses active learning to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see [Using Automated Data Labeling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-automated-labeling.html). The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create a manifest file that describes the location of each object. For more information, see [Using Input and Output Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-data.html). The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or as training data for your machine learning models. You can use this operation to create a static labeling job or a streaming labeling job. A static labeling job stops if all data objects in the input manifest file identified in ManifestS3Uri have been labeled. A streaming labeling job runs perpetually until it is manually stopped, or remains idle for 10 days. You can send new data objects to an active (InProgress) streaming labeling job in real time.

Use this API to create a model if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services or run a batch transform job. To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the CreateEndpointConfig API, and then create an endpoint with the CreateEndpoint API. Amazon SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment. For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to Amazon SageMaker hosting services, see [Deploy the Model to Amazon SageMaker Hosting Services (Amazon Web Services SDK for Python (Boto 3)).](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1-deploy-model.html#ex1-deploy-model-boto) To run a batch transform using your model, you start a job with the CreateTransformJob API. Amazon SageMaker uses your model and your dataset to get inferences which are then saved to a specified S3 location. In the CreateModel request, you must define a container with the PrimaryContainer parameter. In the request, you also provide an IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances or for batch transform jobs. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs. For example, if the inference code access any other Amazon Web Services resources, you grant necessary permissions via this role.
