/// <p>Specifies a limit to how long a model training job, model compilation job, or
///             hyperparameter tuning job can run. It also specifies how long a managed Spot training
///             job has to complete.
///             When the job reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training or compilation job. Use this
///             API to cap model training costs.</p>
///         <p>To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal, which delays
///             job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the
///             model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. </p>
///         <p>The training algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results
///             of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best
///             effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if
///             training has just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this
///             intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a model with
///                 <code>CreateModel</code>.</p>
///         <note>
///             <p>The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model
///                 artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for
///                 the training job to complete.</p>
