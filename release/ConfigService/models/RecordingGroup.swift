/// <p>Specifies the types of AWS resource for which AWS Config
/// 			records configuration changes.</p>
/// 		       <p>In the recording group, you specify whether all supported types
/// 			or specific types of resources are recorded.</p>
/// 		       <p>By default, AWS Config records configuration changes for all
/// 			supported types of regional resources that AWS Config discovers in
/// 			the region in which it is running. Regional resources are tied to a
/// 			region and can be used only in that region. Examples of regional
/// 			resources are EC2 instances and EBS volumes.</p>
/// 		       <p>You can also have AWS Config record configuration changes for
/// 			supported types of global resources (for example, IAM resources).
/// 			Global resources are not tied to an individual region and can be
/// 			used in all regions.</p>
/// 		       <important>
/// 			         <p>The configuration details for any global resource are the
/// 				same in all regions. If you customize AWS Config in multiple
/// 				regions to record global resources, it will create multiple
/// 				configuration items each time a global resource changes: one
/// 				configuration item for each region. These configuration items
/// 				will contain identical data. To prevent duplicate configuration
/// 				items, you should consider customizing AWS Config in only one
/// 				region to record global resources, unless you want the
/// 				configuration items to be available in multiple
/// 				regions.</p>
