/// <fullname>AWS Config</fullname>
///
/// 		       <p>AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations
/// 			of all the AWS resources associated with your AWS account. You can
/// 			use AWS Config to get the current and historical configurations of
/// 			each AWS resource and also to get information about the relationship
/// 			between the resources. An AWS resource can be an Amazon Compute
/// 			Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an
/// 			elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete
/// 			list of resources currently supported by AWS Config, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported AWS Resources</a>.</p>
///
/// 		       <p>You can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management
/// 			Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Config
/// 			API, or the AWS SDKs for AWS Config. This reference guide contains
/// 			documentation for the AWS Config API and the AWS CLI commands that
/// 			you can use to manage AWS Config. The AWS Config API uses the
/// 			Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more
/// 			information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see
/// 				<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
/// 				Version 4 Signing Process</a>. For detailed information
/// 			about AWS Config features and their associated actions or commands,
/// 			as well as how to work with AWS Management Console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html">What Is AWS
/// 				Config</a> in the <i>AWS Config Developer
/// 				Guide</i>.</p>
