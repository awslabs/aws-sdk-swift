/// <p>Contains an asset metric property. With metrics, you can calculate aggregate functions,
///       such as an average, maximum, or minimum, as specified through an expression. A metric maps
///       several values to a single value (such as a sum).</p>
///          <p>The maximum number of dependent/cascading variables used in any one metric calculation is
///       10. Therefore, a <i>root</i> metric can have
///       up to 10 cascading metrics in its computational dependency
///       tree. Additionally, a metric can only have a data type of <code>DOUBLE</code> and consume
///       properties with data types of <code>INTEGER</code> or <code>DOUBLE</code>.</p>
