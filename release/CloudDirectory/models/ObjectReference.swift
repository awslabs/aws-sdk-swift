Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names are separated by slashes. For more information about paths, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clouddirectory/latest/developerguide/directory_objects_access_objects.html">Access Objects</a>. You can identify an object in one of the following ways:</p>

When creating objects, the system will provide you with the identifier of the created object. An objectâ€™s identifier is immutable and no two objects will ever share the same object identifier</p>

    ///             <li>
    ///                <p>
