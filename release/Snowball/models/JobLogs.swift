/// <p>Contains job logs. Whenever a Snow device is used to import data into or export data out of
///       Amazon S3, you'll have the option of downloading a PDF job report. Job logs are returned as a
///       part of the response syntax of the <code>DescribeJob</code> action in the
///         <code>JobMetadata</code> data type. The job logs can be accessed for up to 60 minutes after
///       this request has been made. To access any of the job logs after 60 minutes have passed, you'll
///       have to make another call to the <code>DescribeJob</code> action.</p>
///
///          <p>For import jobs, the PDF job report becomes available at the end of the import process.
///       For export jobs, your job report typically becomes available while the Snow device for your job
///       part is being delivered to you.</p>
///
///          <p>The job report provides you insight into the state of your Amazon S3 data transfer. The

///       two associated logs: a success log and a failure log. The logs are saved in comma-separated
