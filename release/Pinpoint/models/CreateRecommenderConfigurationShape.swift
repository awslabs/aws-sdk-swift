The characters can be letters, numbers, underscores (_), or hyphens (-). Attribute names are case sensitive and must be unique.</p></li> <li><p>An attribute display name must start with a letter or number and it can contain up to 25 characters.

The data is correlated based on endpoint IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. This is the default value.</p></li> <li><p>PINPOINT_USER_ID - Associate each user in the model with a particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If you specify this value, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has to specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise, messages won’t be sent to the user's endpoint.</p></li></ul>
