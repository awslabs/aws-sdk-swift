/// Amazon Security Lake is in preview release. Your use of the Security Lake preview is subject to Section 2 of the [Amazon Web Services Service Terms](http://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/)("Betas and Previews"). Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service. You can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from cloud, on-premises, and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount. Amazon Web Services Organizations is an account management service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. With Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization. Security Lake helps you analyze security data for a more complete understanding of your security posture across the entire organization. It can also help you improve the protection of your workloads, applications, and data. The data lake is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and you retain ownership over your data. Amazon Security Lake integrates with CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an Amazon Web Services service in Security Lake CloudTrail captures API calls for Security Lake as events. The calls captured include calls from the Security Lake console and code calls to the Security Lake API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Security Lake. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail you can determine the request that was made to Security Lake, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details. To learn more about Security Lake information in CloudTrail, see the [Amazon Security Lake User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/securitylake-cloudtrail.html). Security Lake automates the collection of security-related log and event data from integrated Amazon Web Services and third-party services. It also helps you manage the lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication settings. Security Lake converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a standard open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF). Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can subscribe to the data that's stored in Security Lake for incident response and security data analytics.
public protocol SecurityLakeClientProtocol {
    /// Adds a natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security Lake source. Enables source types for member accounts in required Amazon Web Services Regions, based on the parameters you specify. You can choose any source type in any Region for either accounts that are part of a trusted organization or standalone accounts. At least one of the three dimensions is a mandatory input to this API. However, you can supply any combination of the three dimensions to this API. By default, a dimension refers to the entire set. When you don't provide a dimension, Security Lake assumes that the missing dimension refers to the entire set. This is overridden when you supply any one of the inputs. For instance, when you do not specify members, the API enables all Security Lake member accounts for all sources. Similarly, when you do not specify Regions, Security Lake is enabled for all the Regions where Security Lake is available as a service. You can use this API only to enable natively supported Amazon Web Services as a source. Use CreateCustomLogSource to enable data collection from a custom source.
    func createAwsLogSource(input: CreateAwsLogSourceInput) async throws -> CreateAwsLogSourceOutputResponse
    /// Adds a third-party custom source in Amazon Security Lake, from the Amazon Web Services Region where you want to create a custom source. Security Lake can collect logs and events from third-party custom sources. After creating the appropriate IAM role to invoke Glue crawler, use this API to add a custom source name in Security Lake. This operation creates a partition in the Amazon S3 bucket for Security Lake as the target location for log files from the custom source in addition to an associated Glue table and an Glue crawler.
    func createCustomLogSource(input: CreateCustomLogSourceInput) async throws -> CreateCustomLogSourceOutputResponse
    /// Initializes an Amazon Security Lake instance with the provided (or default) configuration. You can enable Security Lake in Amazon Web Services Regions with customized settings before enabling log collection in Regions. You can either use the enableAll parameter to specify all Regions or specify the Regions where you want to enable Security Lake. To specify particular Regions, use the Regions parameter and then configure these Regions using the configurations parameter. If you have already enabled Security Lake in a Region when you call this command, the command will update the Region if you provide new configuration parameters. If you have not already enabled Security Lake in the Region when you call this API, it will set up the data lake in the Region with the specified configurations. When you enable Security Lake, it starts ingesting security data after the CreateAwsLogSource call. This includes ingesting security data from sources, storing data, and making data accessible to subscribers. Security Lake also enables all the existing settings and resources that it stores or maintains for your Amazon Web Services account in the current Region, including security log and event data. For more information, see the [Amazon Security Lake User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/what-is-security-lake.html).

    /// Removes a natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security Lake source. When you remove the source, Security Lake stops collecting data from that source, and subscribers can no longer consume new data from the source. Subscribers can still consume data that Security Lake collected from the source before disablement. You can choose any source type in any Amazon Web Services Region for either accounts that are part of a trusted organization or standalone accounts. At least one of the three dimensions is a mandatory input to this API. However, you can supply any combination of the three dimensions to this API. By default, a dimension refers to the entire set. This is overridden when you supply any one of the inputs. For instance, when you do not specify members, the API disables all Security Lake member accounts for sources. Similarly, when you do not specify Regions, Security Lake is disabled for all the Regions where Security Lake is available as a service. When you don't provide a dimension, Security Lake assumes that the missing dimension refers to the entire set. For example, if you don't provide specific accounts, the API applies to the entire set of accounts in your organization.
