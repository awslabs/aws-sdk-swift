///       can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can configure
///       rules to:</p>
///          <ul>
///             <li>
///                <p>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event

///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for
///           detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
