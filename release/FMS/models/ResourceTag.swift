/// <p>The resource tags that AWS Firewall Manager uses to determine if a particular resource
///       should be included or excluded from the AWS Firewall Manager policy. Tags enable you to
///       categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or
///       environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. Firewall Manager combines the
///       tags with "AND" so that, if you add more than one tag to a policy scope, a resource must have
///         all the specified tags to be included or excluded. For more information, see
