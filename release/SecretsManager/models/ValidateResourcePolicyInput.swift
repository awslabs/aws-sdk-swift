    ///          <note>
    ///             <p>If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can
    ///         specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random
    ///         characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN
    ///         match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a
    ///         name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six
    ///         characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause
    ///         Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected
    ///         results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending
    ///         with a hyphen followed by six characters.</p>
    ///             <p>If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the
    ///         'friendly name', you <i>must</i> not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager,
    ///         you receive either a <i>ResourceNotFoundException</i> or an <i>AccessDeniedException</i> error, depending on your permissions.</p>
