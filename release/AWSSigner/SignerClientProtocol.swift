/// AWS Signer is a fully managed code signing service to help you ensure the trust and integrity of your code. AWS Signer supports the following applications: With code signing for AWS Lambda, you can sign AWS Lambda deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3. With code signing for IoT, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for [Amazon FreeRTOS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/) and [AWS IoT Device Management](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/), and is integrated with [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/). In order to sign code, you import a third-party code signing certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management. For more information about AWS Signer, see the [AWS Signer Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).
