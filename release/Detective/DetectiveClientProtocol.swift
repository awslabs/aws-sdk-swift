/// <p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you analyze and
///          investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically
///          extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from
///          AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by
///          Amazon GuardDuty.</p>
///          <p>The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A

///          and managed by an administrator account.</p>

///          that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.</p>
