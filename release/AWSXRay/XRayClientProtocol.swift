    /// Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented applications. Services retrieve rules with [GetSamplingRules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingRules.html), and evaluate each rule in ascending order of priority for each request. If a rule matches, the service records a trace, borrowing it from the reservoir size. After 10 seconds, the service reports back to X-Ray with [GetSamplingTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingTargets.html) to get updated versions of each in-use rule. The updated rule contains a trace quota that the service can use instead of borrowing from the reservoir.

    /// * trace_id - A unique identifier that connects all segments and subsegments originating from a single client request.
    ///
    /// * start_time - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds. For example, 1480615200.010 or 1.480615200010E9.
    ///
    /// * end_time - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For example, 1480615200.090 or 1.480615200090E9. Specify either an end_time or in_progress.
    ///
    /// * in_progress - Set to true instead of specifying an end_time to record that a segment has been started, but is not complete. Send an in-progress segment when your application receives a request that will take a long time to serve, to trace that the request was received. When the response is sent, send the complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment.
