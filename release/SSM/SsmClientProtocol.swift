///          <p>AWS Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as
///    collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of
///    Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale.
///    Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A
///     <i>managed instance</i> is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance (EC2 instance), or any
///    on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) in your hybrid environment that has been configured
///    for Systems Manager.</p>
