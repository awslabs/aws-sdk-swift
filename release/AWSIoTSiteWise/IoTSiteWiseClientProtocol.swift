/// Welcome to the IoT SiteWise API Reference. IoT SiteWise is an Amazon Web Services service that connects [Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things#Industrial_applications) devices to the power of the Amazon Web Services Cloud. For more information, see the [IoT SiteWise User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/). For information about IoT SiteWise quotas, see [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/quotas.html) in the IoT SiteWise User Guide.

For more information, see [Ingesting data using the API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/ingest-api.html) in the IoT SiteWise User Guide. To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:
    ///
    /// * The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.
    ///
    /// * A propertyAlias, which is a data stream alias (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature). To define an asset property's alias, see [UpdateAssetProperty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetProperty.html).
    ///
    ///
    /// With respect to Unix epoch time, IoT SiteWise accepts only TQVs that have a timestamp of no more than 7 days in the past and no more than 10 minutes in the future. IoT SiteWise rejects timestamps outside of the inclusive range of [-7 days, +10 minutes] and returns a TimestampOutOfRangeException error. For each asset property, IoT SiteWise overwrites TQVs with duplicate timestamps unless the newer TQV has a different quality. For example, if you store a TQV {T1, GOOD, V1}, then storing {T1, GOOD, V2} replaces the existing TQV. IoT SiteWise authorizes access to each BatchPutAssetPropertyValue entry individually.
