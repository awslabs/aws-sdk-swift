The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider. If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see [Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) in the IAM User Guide. When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:

These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation. The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates.

You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the Amazon Web Services Management Console or one that supports API access to Amazon Web Services.

Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate does change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated. Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation. Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint.
