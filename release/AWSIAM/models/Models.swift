For example, you might have multiple applications that use the same OIDC provider. You cannot register more than 100 client IDs with a single IAM OIDC provider.

The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string. You must provide at least one thumbprint when creating an IAM OIDC provider. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.example.com and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.

If users signed in during the affected time, the password last used date that is returned is the date the user last signed in before May 3, 2018. For users that signed in after May 23, 2018 14:08 PDT, the returned password last used date is accurate. You can use password last used information to identify unused credentials for deletion. For example, you might delete users who did not sign in to Amazon Web Services in the last 90 days. In cases like this, we recommend that you adjust your evaluation window to include dates after May 23, 2018. Alternatively, if your users use access keys to access Amazon Web Services programmatically you can refer to access key last used information because it is accurate for all dates.

    public var resourceHandlingOption: Swift.String?
    /// An ARN representing the Amazon Web Services account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ResourceOwner is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation. If the ResourceOwner parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in CallerArn. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user CallerArn. The ARN for an account uses the following syntax: arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:root. For example, to represent the account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN: arn:aws:iam::112233445566-ID:root.
    public var resourceOwner: Swift.String?
    /// A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation. The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see [IAM and STS character quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length). The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:
    ///
    /// * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range
    ///
    /// * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \u00FF)
    ///
    /// * The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D)

    /// The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that the entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. An IAM entity can only have one permissions boundary in effect at a time. For example, if a permissions boundary is attached to an entity and you pass in a different permissions boundary policy using this parameter, then the new permissions boundary policy is used for the simulation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see [Permissions boundaries for IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) in the IAM User Guide. The policy input is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy. The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see [IAM and STS character quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length).

Each API in the ActionNames parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account. The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the ResourcePolicy parameter. For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation. Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see [Supported platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ResourceOwner is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation. If the ResourceOwner parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in CallerArn. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user CallerArn.
