/// <p>Amazon EMR on EKS provides a deployment option for Amazon EMR that allows you to run
///          open-source big data frameworks on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). With
///          this deployment option, you can focus on running analytics workloads while Amazon EMR on
///          EKS builds, configures, and manages containers for open-source applications. For more
///          information about Amazon EMR on EKS concepts and tasks, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/emr-eks.html">What is Amazon EMR on EKS</a>.</p>

///             <i>Amazon EMR containers</i> is the API name for Amazon EMR on EKS. The

///             <li>
///                <p>It is the prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, <code>aws

///             <li>
