///             <b>Overview</b>
///         </p>
///         <p>This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the
///             actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline can
///             only be configured through the API. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS
///                 CodePipeline User Guide</a>.</p>
///         <p>You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and
///             transitions.</p>
///         <p>
///             <i>Pipelines</i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline
///             is uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. </p>
///         <p>You can work with pipelines by calling:</p>
///         <ul>
///             <li>
///                 <p>
///                     <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which creates a uniquely named

///             </li>
///          </ul>
///         <p>Pipelines include <i>stages</i>. Each stage contains one or more
///             actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or
///             failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until
///             either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes
///             action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the
///             status of stages in the pipeline, or <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the
///             entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more
///             information about the structure of stages and actions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html">AWS CodePipeline
///                 Pipeline Structure Reference</a>.</p>
///         <p>Pipeline stages include <i>actions</i> that are categorized into
///             categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For
///             example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source
///             such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but
///             you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as
///                 <a>CreatePipeline</a> and <a>GetPipelineState</a>. Valid
///             action categories are:</p>
///         <ul>
///             <li>
///                 <p>Source</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>Build</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>Test</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>Deploy</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>

///                 <p>Invoke</p>
///             </li>
///          </ul>
///         <p>Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the transition
///             of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage
///             complete.</p>
///         <p>You can work with transitions by calling:</p>
///         <ul>
///             <li>
///                 <p>
///                     <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents artifacts from
///                     transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>
///                     <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of artifacts
///                     between stages in a pipeline. </p>
///             </li>
///          </ul>

///             <b>Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline</b>
///         </p>
///         <p>For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations
///             with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To

///             items:</p>
///         <p>
///             <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For
