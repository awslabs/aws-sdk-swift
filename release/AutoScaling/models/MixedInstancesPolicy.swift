/// <p>Describes a mixed instances policy for an Auto Scaling group. With mixed instances, your Auto Scaling
///             group can provision a combination of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances across
///             multiple instance types. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-purchase-options.html">Auto Scaling groups with multiple

///         <p>You can create a mixed instances policy for a new Auto Scaling group, or you can create it for
///             an existing group by updating the group to specify <code>MixedInstancesPolicy</code> as
