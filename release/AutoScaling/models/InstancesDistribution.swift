/// <p>Describes an instances distribution for an Auto Scaling group with a <a>MixedInstancesPolicy</a>.</p>
///         <p>The instances distribution specifies the distribution of On-Demand Instances and Spot
///             Instances, the maximum price to pay for Spot Instances, and how the Auto Scaling group allocates
///             instance types to fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities.</p>
///         <p>When you update <code>SpotAllocationStrategy</code>, <code>SpotInstancePools</code>,
///             or <code>SpotMaxPrice</code>, this update action does not deploy any changes across the
///             running Amazon EC2 instances in the group. Your existing Spot Instances continue to run
///             as long as the maximum price for those instances is higher than the current Spot price.
///             When scale out occurs, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances based on the new settings. When scale
///             in occurs, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates instances according to the group's termination
///             policies.</p>
