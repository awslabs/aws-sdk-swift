///          <p>Amazon Rekognition makes gender binary (male/female) predictions based on the physical appearance
///       of a face in a particular image. This kind of prediction is not designed to categorize a person’s gender
///       identity, and you shouldn't use Amazon Rekognition to make such a determination. For example, a male actor
///       wearing a long-haired wig and earrings for a role might be predicted as female.</p>
///
///          <p>Using Amazon Rekognition to make gender binary predictions is best suited for use cases where aggregate gender distribution statistics need to be
///       analyzed without identifying specific users. For example, the percentage of female users compared to male users on a social media platform. </p>

///          <p>We don't recommend using gender binary predictions to make decisions that impact  an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services.</p>
