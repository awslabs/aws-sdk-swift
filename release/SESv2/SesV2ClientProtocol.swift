///         <p>
///             <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon SES</a> is an AWS service that
///             you can use to send email messages to your customers.</p>
///         <p>If you're new to Amazon SES API v2, you might find it helpful to also review the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/">Amazon Simple Email Service Developer
///                 Guide</a>. The <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide</i> provides information
///             and code samples that demonstrate how to use Amazon SES API v2 features programmatically.</p>
///         <p>The Amazon SES API v2 is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each
///             of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently
///             available, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ses_region">AWS Service Endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>. To
///             learn more about AWS Regions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing AWS Regions</a> in the
///                 <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
///         <p>In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones
///             are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private, low-latency,
///             high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability Zones
///             enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also
///             minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are
///             available in each Region, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a>.</p>
