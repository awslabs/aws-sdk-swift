///             be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you
///             provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your
///             customers. We send that message to special email addresses spread across several major
///             email providers around the world. The test takes about 24 hours to complete. When the
///             test is complete, you can use the <code>GetDeliverabilityTestReport</code> operation to
///             view the results of the test.</p>
