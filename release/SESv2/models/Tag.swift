/// <p>An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource.
///                 A <i>tag</i> is a label that you optionally define and associate with
///             a resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as
///             by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50
///             tags.</p>
///         <p>Each tag consists of a required <i>tag key</i> and an
///                 associated <i>tag value</i>, both of which you define. A tag key is a
///             general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as
///             a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag
///             value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters,
///             digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following
///             additional restrictions apply to tags:</p>
///         <ul>
///             <li>
///                 <p>Tag keys and values are case sensitive.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only
///                     one value.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>The <code>aws:</code> prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in
///                     any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove
///                     tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count
///                     against the limit of 50 tags per resource.</p>

///             <li>
///                 <p>You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are
///                     available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the
///                     resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are
///                     located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account.</p>
