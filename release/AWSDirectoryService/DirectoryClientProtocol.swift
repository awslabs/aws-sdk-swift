/// Directory Service Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the Amazon Web Services cloud, or connect your Amazon Web Services resources with an existing self-managed Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides detailed information about Directory Service operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For information about Directory Services features, see [Directory Service](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) and the [Directory Service Administration Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html). Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Directory Service and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

This shared directory contains the metadata to provide access to the directory within the directory owner account. The shared directory is visible in all VPCs in the directory consumer account. The ShareMethod parameter determines whether the specified directory can be shared between Amazon Web Services accounts inside the same Amazon Web Services organization (ORGANIZATIONS).
