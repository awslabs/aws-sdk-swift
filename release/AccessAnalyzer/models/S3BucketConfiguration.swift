/// <p>Proposed access control configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. You can propose a
///          configuration for a new Amazon S3 bucket or an existing Amazon S3 bucket that you own by specifying
///          the Amazon S3 bucket policy, bucket ACLs, bucket BPA settings, and Amazon S3 access points attached
///          to the bucket. If the configuration is for an existing Amazon S3 bucket and you do not specify
///          the Amazon S3 bucket policy, the access preview uses the existing policy attached to the bucket.
///          If the access preview is for a new resource and you do not specify the Amazon S3 bucket policy,
///          the access preview assumes a bucket without a policy. To propose deletion of an existing
///          bucket policy, you can specify an empty string. For more information about bucket policy
