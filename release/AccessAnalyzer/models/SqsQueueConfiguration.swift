/// <p>The proposed access control configuration for an SQS queue. You can propose a
///          configuration for a new SQS queue or an existing SQS queue that you own by specifying the
///          SQS policy. If the configuration is for an existing SQS queue and you do not specify the
///          SQS policy, the access preview uses the existing SQS policy for the queue. If the access
///          preview is for a new resource and you do not specify the policy, the access preview assumes
///          an SQS queue without a policy. To propose deletion of an existing SQS queue policy, you can
///          specify an empty string for the SQS policy. For more information about SQS policy limits,
