/// <p>The proposed access control configuration for an IAM role. You can propose a
///          configuration for a new IAM role or an existing IAM role that you own by specifying the
///          trust policy. If the configuration is for a new IAM role, you must specify the trust
///          policy. If the configuration is for an existing IAM role that you own and you do not
///          propose the trust policy, the access preview uses the existing trust policy for the role.
///          The proposed trust policy cannot be an empty string. For more information about role trust
