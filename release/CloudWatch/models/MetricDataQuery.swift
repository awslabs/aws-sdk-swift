/// <p>This structure is used in both <code>GetMetricData</code> and <code>PutMetricAlarm</code>. The supported
/// 			use of this structure is different for those two operations.</p>
/// 		       <p>When used in <code>GetMetricData</code>, it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving
/// 			a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math expression on metric data. A
/// 			single <code>GetMetricData</code> call can include up to 500 <code>MetricDataQuery</code>
/// 			structures.</p>
/// 		       <p>When used in <code>PutMetricAlarm</code>, it enables you to create an alarm based on a
/// 			metric math expression. Each <code>MetricDataQuery</code> in the array specifies either
/// 			a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A
/// 			single <code>PutMetricAlarm</code> call can include up to 20
/// 				<code>MetricDataQuery</code> structures in the array. The 20 structures can include
/// 			as many as 10 structures that contain a <code>MetricStat</code> parameter to retrieve a
/// 			metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the <code>Expression</code> parameter
/// 			to perform a math expression. Of those <code>Expression</code> structures, one must have <code>True</code>
/// 		as the value for <code>ReturnData</code>. The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.</p>
///
/// 		       <p>Any expression used in a <code>PutMetricAlarm</code>
/// 			operation must return a single time series. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax">Metric Math Syntax and Functions</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User
/// 				Guide</i>.</p>
///
/// 		       <p>Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a <code>GetMetricData</code>
/// 			operation or a <code>PutMetricAlarm</code> operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.</p>
