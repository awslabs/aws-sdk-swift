/// AWS Step Functions AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components, each of which performs a discrete function, or task, allowing you to scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly diagnose and debug any issues. Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is available at any scale. You can run tasks on AWS, your own servers, or any system that has access to AWS. You can access and use Step Functions using the console, the AWS SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the [AWS Step Functions Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) .

    /// Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any machine that has access to AWS Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the GetActivityTask API action and respond using SendTask* API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity. This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes. CreateActivity is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. CreateActivity's idempotency check is based on the activity name. If a following request has different tags values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, tags will not be updated, even if they are different.
    func createActivity(input: CreateActivityInput) async throws -> CreateActivityOutputResponse
    /// Creates a state machine. A state machine consists of a collection of states that can do work (Task states), determine to which states to transition next (Choice states), stop an execution with an error (Fail states), and so on. State machines are specified using a JSON-based, structured language. For more information, see [Amazon States Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html) in the AWS Step Functions User Guide. This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes. CreateStateMachine is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. CreateStateMachine's idempotency check is based on the state machine name, definition, type, LoggingConfiguration and TracingConfiguration. If a following request has a different roleArn or tags, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, roleArn and tags will not be updated, even if they are different.

For EXPRESSstate machines, the deletion will happen eventually (usually less than a minute). Running executions may emit logs after DeleteStateMachine API is called.

    /// Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN) which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine. This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a task of this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns a taskToken with a null string. Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 65 seconds (5 seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold the poll request). Polling with GetActivityTask can cause latency in some implementations. See [Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/bp-activity-pollers.html) in the Step Functions Developer Guide.

Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours.

This action resets the Heartbeat clock. The Heartbeat threshold is specified in the state machine's Amazon States Language definition (HeartbeatSeconds). This action does not in itself create an event in the execution history. However, if the task times out, the execution history contains an ActivityTimedOut entry for activities, or a TaskTimedOut entry for for tasks using the [job run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-sync) or [callback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token) pattern. The Timeout of a task, defined in the state machine's Amazon States Language definition, is its maximum allowed duration, regardless of the number of [SendTaskHeartbeat] requests received. Use HeartbeatSeconds to configure the timeout interval for heartbeats.
