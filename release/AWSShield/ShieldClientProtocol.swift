/// Shield Advanced This is the Shield Advanced API Reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Shield Advanced API actions, data types, and errors.

    /// Authorizes the Shield Response Team (SRT) to access the specified Amazon S3 bucket containing log data such as Application Load Balancer access logs, CloudFront logs, or logs from third party sources. You can associate up to 10 Amazon S3 buckets with your subscription. To use the services of the SRT and make an AssociateDRTLogBucket request, you must be subscribed to the [Business Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/) or the [Enterprise Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/enterprise-support/).

    /// Authorizes the Shield Response Team (SRT) using the specified role, to access your Amazon Web Services account to assist with DDoS attack mitigation during potential attacks. This enables the SRT to inspect your WAF configuration and create or update WAF rules and web ACLs. You can associate only one RoleArn with your subscription. If you submit an AssociateDRTRole request for an account that already has an associated role, the new RoleArn will replace the existing RoleArn. Prior to making the AssociateDRTRole request, you must attach the AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy managed policy to the role that you'll specify in the request. You can access this policy in the IAM console at [AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy). For more information see [Adding and removing IAM identity permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html). The role must also trust the service principal drt.shield.amazonaws.com. For more information, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html). The SRT will have access only to your WAF and Shield resources. By submitting this request, you authorize the SRT to inspect your WAF and Shield configuration and create and update WAF rules and web ACLs on your behalf. The SRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by you. You must have the iam:PassRole permission to make an AssociateDRTRole request. For more information, see [Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an Amazon Web Services service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html). To use the services of the SRT and make an AssociateDRTRole request, you must be subscribed to the [Business Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/) or the [Enterprise Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/enterprise-support/).

Shield Advanced health-based detection uses the health of your Amazon Web Services resource to improve responsiveness and accuracy in attack detection and response.

For more information, see [Shield Advanced Health-Based Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-overview.html#ddos-advanced-health-check-option) in the WAF Developer Guide.

This call defines the list of email addresses and phone numbers that the SRT can use to contact you for escalations to the SRT and to initiate proactive customer support. The contacts that you provide in the request replace any contacts that were already defined. If you already have contacts defined and want to use them, retrieve the list using DescribeEmergencyContactSettings and then provide it to this call.

You can add protection to multiple resources at once through the Shield Advanced console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/).

For example, if the current time is 2020-10-26 15:39:32 PDT, equal to 2020-10-26 22:39:32 UTC, then the time range for the attack data returned is from 2019-10-26 00:00:00 UTC to 2020-10-26 00:00:00 UTC.

This causes Shield Advanced to create, verify, and apply WAF rules for DDoS attacks that it detects for the resource. Shield Advanced applies the rules in a Shield rule group inside the web ACL that you've associated with the resource. For information about how automatic mitigation works and the requirements for using it, see [Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-advanced-automatic-app-layer-response.html). Don't use this action to make changes to automatic mitigation settings when it's already enabled for a resource. Instead, use [UpdateApplicationLayerAutomaticResponse]. To use this feature, you must associate a web ACL with the protected resource. The web ACL must be created using the latest version of WAF (v2). You can associate the web ACL through the Shield Advanced console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/). For more information, see [Getting Started with Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/getting-started-ddos.html). You can also do this through the WAF console or the WAF API, but you must manage Shield Advanced automatic mitigation through Shield Advanced. For information about WAF, see [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/).
