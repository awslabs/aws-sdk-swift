///       <i>featurization</i>.</p>
///          <p>You define featurization using the <code>FeaturizationConfig</code> object.
///       You specify an array of transformations, one for each field that you want to
///       featurize. You then include the <code>FeaturizationConfig</code> object in your
///       <code>CreatePredictor</code> request. Amazon Forecast applies the featurization to the
///       <code>TARGET_TIME_SERIES</code> and <code>RELATED_TIME_SERIES</code> datasets before model training.</p>
