/// <p>A verified or pending destination phone number in the SMS sandbox.</p>
///         <p>When you start using Amazon SNS to send SMS messages, your AWS account is in the
///                 <i>SMS sandbox</i>. The SMS sandbox provides a safe environment for
///                 you to try Amazon SNS features without risking your reputation as an SMS sender. While your
///                 account is in the SMS sandbox, you can use all of the features of Amazon SNS. However, you can send
///                 SMS messages only to verified destination phone numbers. For more information, including how to
///                 move out of the sandbox to send messages without restrictions,
///                 see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html">SMS sandbox</a> in
///                 the <i>Amazon SNS Developer Guide</i>.</p>
