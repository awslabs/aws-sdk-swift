///          <p>AWS App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source code
///       to a running service in the AWS cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to
///       provision and configure AWS resources.</p>
///          <p>App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations,
///       high performance, scalability, and security.</p>
///          <p>For more information about App Runner, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/">AWS App Runner Developer Guide</a>.
///       For release information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/">AWS App Runner Release Notes</a>.</p>
