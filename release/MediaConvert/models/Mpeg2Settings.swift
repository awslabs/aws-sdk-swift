If you want to do frame rate conversion, choose a frame rate from the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates shown in the dropdown list are decimal approximations of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating your transcoding job specification as a JSON file without the console, use FramerateControl to specify which value the service uses for the frame rate for this output. Choose INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the frame rate from the input.

We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP) for numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

Use Top field first (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create an output that's interlaced with the same field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same field polarity as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the output field polarity might change over the course of the output. Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If the source is interlaced, the output will be interlaced with the same polarity as the source. If the source is progressive, the output will be interlaced with top field bottom field first, depending on which of the Follow options you choose.

    public let parControl: Mpeg2ParControl?
    /// Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On the console, this corresponds to any value other than Follow source. When you specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is different from your input video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.

    /// Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).
    public let scanTypeConversionMode: Mpeg2ScanTypeConversionMode?
    /// Enable this setting to insert I-frames at scene changes that the service automatically detects. This improves video quality and is enabled by default.
    public let sceneChangeDetect: Mpeg2SceneChangeDetect?
    /// Ignore this setting unless your input frame rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling this setting will slightly reduce the duration of your video. Required settings: You must also set Framerate to 25. In your JSON job specification, set (framerateControl) to (SPECIFIED), (framerateNumerator) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to 1.
    public let slowPal: Mpeg2SlowPal?
    /// Ignore this setting unless you need to comply with a specification that requires a specific value. If you don't have a specification requirement, we recommend that you adjust the softness of your output by using a lower value for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or by enabling a noise reducer filter (noiseReducerFilter). The Softness (softness) setting specifies the quantization matrices that the encoder uses. Keep the default value, 0, to use the AWS Elemental default matrices. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar interpolation. Increasing values from 17 to 128 result in increasing reduction of high-frequency data. The value 128 results in the softest video.
    public let softness: Int
    /// Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the value for Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization) depending on your content. For homogeneous content, such as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For content with a wider variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.
    public let spatialAdaptiveQuantization: Mpeg2SpatialAdaptiveQuantization?
    /// Specify whether this output's video uses the D10 syntax. Keep the default value to  not use the syntax. Related settings: When you choose D10 (D_10) for your MXF  profile (profile), you must also set this value to to D10 (D_10).
    public let syntax: Mpeg2Syntax?
    /// When you do frame rate conversion from 23.976 frames per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally enable hard or soft telecine to create a smoother picture. Hard telecine (HARD) produces a 29.97i output. Soft telecine (SOFT) produces an output with a 23.976 output that signals to the video player device to do the conversion during play back. When you keep the default value, None (NONE), MediaConvert does a standard frame rate conversion to 29.97 without doing anything with the field polarity to create a smoother picture.
    public let telecine: Mpeg2Telecine?
    /// Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that aren't moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that move a lot. For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn't have moving objects with sharp edges, such as sports athletes' faces, you might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable temporal quantization, adjust the strength of the filter with the setting Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization).
