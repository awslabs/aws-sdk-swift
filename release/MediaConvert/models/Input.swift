The service concatenates these inputs, in the order that you specify them in the job, to create the outputs. If your input format is IMF, specify your input by providing the path to your CPL. For example, "s3://bucket/vf/cpl.xml".

You must also enable the filters separately, with Denoise (InputDenoiseFilter) and Deblock (InputDeblockFilter). * Auto - The transcoding service determines whether to apply filtering, depending on input type and quality. * Disable - The input is not filtered. This is true even if you use the API to enable them in (InputDeblockFilter) and (InputDeblockFilter). * Force - The input is filtered regardless of input type.

If you provide only a start time, the clip will be the entire input from that point to the end. If you provide only an end time, it will be the entire input up to that point. When you specify more than one input clip, the transcoding service creates the job outputs by stringing the clips together in the order you specify them.

    /// When you have a progressive segmented frame (PsF) input, use this setting to flag the input as PsF. MediaConvert doesn't automatically detect PsF. Therefore, flagging your input as PsF results in better preservation of video quality when you do deinterlacing and frame rate conversion. If you don't specify, the default value is Auto (AUTO). Auto is the correct setting for all inputs that are not PsF. Don't set this value to PsF when your input is interlaced. Doing so creates horizontal interlacing artifacts.

If you specify a value here, it will override any value that you specify in the output setting Selection placement (position). If you specify a value here, this will override any AFD values in your input, even if you set Respond to AFD (RespondToAfd) to Respond (RESPOND). If you specify a value here, this will ignore anything that you specify for the setting Scaling Behavior (scalingBehavior).

Specify either the supplemental IMP directories with a trailing slash or the ASSETMAP.xml files. For example ["s3://bucket/ov/", "s3://bucket/vf2/ASSETMAP.xml"].
