/// Required when you set (Codec) under (AudioDescriptions)>(CodecSettings) to the value AAC. The service accepts one of two mutually exclusive groups of AAC settings--VBR and CBR. To select one of these modes, set the value of Bitrate control mode (rateControlMode) to "VBR" or "CBR".  In VBR mode, you control the audio quality with the setting VBR quality (vbrQuality). In CBR mode, you use the setting Bitrate (bitrate). Defaults and valid values depend on the rate control mode.
public struct AacSettings: Equatable {
    /// Choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD when the input contains pre-mixed main audio + audio description (AD) as a stereo pair. The value for AudioType will be set to 3, which signals to downstream systems that this stream contains "broadcaster mixed AD". Note that the input received by the encoder must contain pre-mixed audio; the encoder does not perform the mixing. When you choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD, the encoder ignores any values you provide in AudioType and  FollowInputAudioType. Choose NORMAL when the input does not contain pre-mixed audio + audio description (AD). In this case, the encoder will use any values you provide for AudioType and FollowInputAudioType.
