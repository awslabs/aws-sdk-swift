/// Settings related to one audio tab on the MediaConvert console. In your job JSON, an instance of AudioDescription is equivalent to one audio tab in the console. Usually, one audio tab corresponds to one output audio track. Depending on how you set up your input audio selectors and whether you use audio selector groups, one audio tab can correspond to a group of output audio tracks.
public struct AudioDescription: Equatable {
    /// When you mimic a multi-channel audio layout with multiple mono-channel tracks, you can tag each channel layout manually. For example, you would tag the tracks that contain your left, right, and center audio with Left (L), Right (R), and Center (C), respectively. When you don't specify a value, MediaConvert labels your track as Center (C) by default. To use audio layout tagging, your output must be in a QuickTime (.mov) container; your audio codec must be AAC, WAV, or AIFF; and you must set up your audio track to have only one channel.

    public let audioNormalizationSettings: AudioNormalizationSettings?
    /// Specifies which audio data to use from each input. In the simplest case, specify an "Audio Selector":#inputs-audio_selector by name based on its order within each input. For example if you specify "Audio Selector 3", then the third audio selector will be used from each input. If an input does not have an "Audio Selector 3", then the audio selector marked as "default" in that input will be used. If there is no audio selector marked as "default", silence will be inserted for the duration of that input. Alternatively, an "Audio Selector Group":#inputs-audio_selector_group name may be specified, with similar default/silence behavior. If no audio_source_name is specified, then "Audio Selector 1" will be chosen automatically.
