Do not choose this when AfdSignaling is set to (NONE).

To include timecodes in this output, set Timecode insertion (VideoTimecodeInsertion) to PIC_TIMING_SEI. To leave them out, set it to DISABLED. Default is DISABLED. When the service inserts timecodes in an output, by default, it uses any embedded timecodes from the input. If none are present, the service will set the timecode for the first output frame to zero. To change this default behavior, adjust the settings under Timecode configuration (TimecodeConfig). In the console, these settings are located under Job > Job settings > Timecode configuration. Note - Timecode source under input settings (InputTimecodeSource) does not affect the timecodes that are inserted in the output. Source under Job settings > Timecode configuration (TimecodeSource) does.
