/// Settings related to SCC captions. SCC is a sidecar format that holds captions in a file that is separate from the video container. Set up sidecar captions in the same output group, but different output from your video. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/scc-srt-output-captions.html. When you work directly in your JSON job specification, include this object and any required children when you set destinationType to SCC.

If the video frame rate is 29.97, choose 29.97 dropframe (FRAMERATE_29_97_DROPFRAME) only if the video has video_insertion=true and drop_frame_timecode=true; otherwise, choose 29.97 non-dropframe (FRAMERATE_29_97_NON_DROPFRAME).
