Choose Specify (SPECIFIED) to have MediaConvert set up the display window based on the values that you specify in related job settings. For video resolutions that are 576 pixels or smaller in height, MediaConvert doesn't include the DDS, regardless of the value you choose for DDS handling (ddsHandling). In this case, it doesn't write the display window data to the PCS either.
