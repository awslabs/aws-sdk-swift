For each additional manifest that you specify, the service creates one HLS manifest and one DASH manifest.

If you do not specify the base filename in the URI, the service will use the filename of the input file. If your job has multiple inputs, the service uses the filename of the first input file.

If you know that player devices are hanging on the final segment of your video because the length of your final segment is too short, use this setting to specify a minimum final segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than your segment length. When you specify a value for this setting, the encoder will combine any final segment that is shorter than the length that you specify with the previous segment. For example, your segment length is 3 seconds and your final segment is .5 seconds without a minimum final segment length; when you set the minimum final segment length to 1, your final segment is 3.5 seconds.

When you choose On-demand (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE), the service signals urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011 in your .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must also set the output group setting Segment control (SegmentControl) to Single file (SINGLE_FILE).

Specify how MediaConvert handles PTS when writing time stamps in output DASH manifests. Choose Match initial PTS (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when you want MediaConvert to use the initial PTS as the first time stamp in the manifest. Choose Zero-based (ZERO_BASED) to have MediaConvert ignore the initial PTS in the video stream and instead write the initial time stamp as zero in the manifest. For outputs that don't have B-frames, the time stamps in your DASH manifests start at zero regardless of your choice here.

Note that segments end on the first keyframe after this number of seconds, so the actual segment length might be slightly longer. If you set Segment control (CmafSegmentControl) to single file, the service puts the content of each output in a single file that has metadata that marks these segments. If you set it to segmented files, the service creates multiple files for each output, each with the content of one segment.
