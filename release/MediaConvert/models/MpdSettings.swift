This markup isn't generally required, but some video players require it to discover and play embedded 608 captions. Keep the default value, Exclude (EXCLUDE), to leave these elements out. When you enable this setting, this is the markup that MediaConvert includes in your manifest: <Accessibility schemeIdUri="urn:scte:dash:cc:cea-608:2015" value="CC1=eng"/>

For this situation, choose Match video duration (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION). In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION). When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert pads the output audio streams with silence or trims them to ensure that the total duration of each audio stream is at least as long as the total duration of the video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file. When you keep the default value, any minor discrepancies between audio and video duration will depend on your output audio codec.

This set of fragmented MP4 files is separate from your video and audio fragmented MP4 files.
