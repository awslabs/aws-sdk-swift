/// Settings related to one captions tab on the MediaConvert console. In your job JSON, an instance of captions DestinationSettings is equivalent to one captions tab in the console. Usually, one captions tab corresponds to one output captions track. Depending on your output captions format, one tab might correspond to a set of output captions tracks. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/including-captions.html.
