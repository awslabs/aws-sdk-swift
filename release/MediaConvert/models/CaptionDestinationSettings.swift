/// Settings related to one captions tab on the MediaConvert console. In your job JSON, an instance of captions DestinationSettings is equivalent to one captions tab in the console. Usually, one captions tab corresponds to one output captions track. Depending on your output captions format, one tab might correspond to a set of output captions tracks. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/including-captions.html.

Note that your choice of video output container constrains your choice of output captions format. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/captions-support-tables.html. If you are using SCTE-20 and you want to create an output that complies with the SCTE-43 spec, choose SCTE-20 plus embedded (SCTE20_PLUS_EMBEDDED). To create a non-compliant output where the embedded captions come first, choose Embedded plus SCTE-20 (EMBEDDED_PLUS_SCTE20).
