/// The Amazon Chime API (application programming interface) is designed for developers to perform key tasks, such as creating and managing Amazon Chime accounts, users, and Voice Connectors. This guide provides detailed information about the Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error codes. It also includes API actions for use with the Amazon Chime SDK, which developers use to build their own communication applications. For more information about the Amazon Chime SDK, see [ Using the Amazon Chime SDK ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meetings-sdk.html) in the Amazon Chime Developer Guide. You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST API to make API calls. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. Each API operation includes links to information about using it with a language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. Using an AWS SDK You don't need to write code to calculate a signature for request authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access keys that you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the [AWS Developer Center](http://aws.amazon.com/developer/). Using the AWS CLI Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information about setting up the AWS CLI, see [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. For a list of available Amazon Chime commands, see the [Amazon Chime commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/chime/index.html) in the AWS CLI Command Reference. Using REST APIs If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your request by providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports signature version 4. For more information, see [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. When making REST API calls, use the service name chime and REST endpoint https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com. Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For more information, see [Identity and Access Management for Amazon Chime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/security-iam.html) in the Amazon Chime Administration Guide.
