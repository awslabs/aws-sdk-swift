This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket.

For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see [Cost allocation and tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html). Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value. For more information, see [ Using cost allocation in Amazon S3 bucket tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html). To use this action, you must have permissions to perform the s3-outposts:PutBucketTagging action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [ Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing access permissions to your Amazon S3 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html). PutBucketTagging has the following special errors:
    ///
    /// * Error code: InvalidTagError

    /// * Description: The tag provided was not a valid tag. This error can occur if the tag did not pass input validation.

    /// Sets the supplied tag-set on an S3 Batch Operations job. A tag is a key-value pair. You can associate S3 Batch Operations tags with any job by sending a PUT request against the tagging subresource that is associated with the job. To modify the existing tag set, you can either replace the existing tag set entirely, or make changes within the existing tag set by retrieving the existing tag set using [GetJobTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetJobTagging.html), modify that tag set, and use this action to replace the tag set with the one you modified.

    ///
    /// * If you send this request with an empty tag set, Amazon S3 deletes the existing tag set on the Batch Operations job. If you use this method, you are charged for a Tier 1 Request (PUT). For more information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

    /// * For deleting existing tags for your Batch Operations job, a [DeleteJobTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteJobTagging.html) request is preferred because it achieves the same result without incurring charges.

    /// * A few things to consider about using tags:
    ///
    /// * Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of tags to 50 tags per job.
    ///
    /// * You can associate up to 50 tags with a job as long as they have unique tag keys.
    ///
    /// * A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode characters in length, and tag values can be up to 256 Unicode characters in length.
    ///
    /// * The key and values are case sensitive.
