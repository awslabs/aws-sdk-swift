/// <p>A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check. A custom health check, which
///    requires that you use a third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in the
///    following circumstances:</p>
///          <ul>
///             <li>
///                <p>You can't use a health check that's defined by <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> because the resource isn't
///      available over the internet. For example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in an Amazon VPC.
///      (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be in the VPC.)</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where your resources are located.</p>
///             </li>
///          </ul>
///          <important>
///             <p>If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either <code>HealthCheckCustomConfig</code> or
///      <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> but not both.</p>
///          </important>
///          <p>To change the status of a custom health check, submit an <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request.
///    AWS Cloud Map doesn't monitor the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status specified in the most recent
///     <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request.</p>
///          <p>Here's how custom health checks work:</p>
///          <ol>
///             <li>
///                <p>You create a service.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>You register an instance.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource that's associated with the new instance. </p>
///                <note>
///                   <p>AWS Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource directly. </p>
///                </note>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is unhealthy and notifies your application.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>Your application submits an <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>AWS Cloud Map waits for 30 seconds.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>If another <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request doesn't arrive during that time to change the
///      status back to healthy, AWS Cloud Map stops routing traffic to the resource.</p>
