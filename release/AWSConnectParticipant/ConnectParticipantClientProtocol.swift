    /// Creates the participant's connection. Note that ParticipantToken is used for invoking this API instead of ConnectionToken. The participant token is valid for the lifetime of the participant – until they are part of a contact. The response URL for WEBSOCKET Type has a connect expiry timeout of 100s. Clients must manually connect to the returned websocket URL and subscribe to the desired topic. For chat, you need to publish the following on the established websocket connection: {"topic":"aws/subscribe","content":{"topics":["aws/chat"]}} Upon websocket URL expiry, as specified in the response ConnectionExpiry parameter, clients need to call this API again to obtain a new websocket URL and perform the same steps as before. Message streaming support: This API can also be used together with the [StartContactStreaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartContactStreaming.html) API to create a participant connection for chat contacts that are not using a websocket. For more information about message streaming, [Enable real-time chat message streaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/chat-message-streaming.html) in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. Feature specifications: For information about feature specifications, such as the allowed number of open websocket connections per participant, see [Feature specifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#feature-limits) in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. The Amazon Connect Participant Service APIs do not use [Signature Version 4 authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
