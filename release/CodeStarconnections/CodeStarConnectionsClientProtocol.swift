/// <fullname>AWS CodeStar Connections</fullname>
///          <p>This AWS CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and usage examples of
///       the operations and data types for the AWS CodeStar Connections API. You can use the
///       connections API to work with connections and installations.</p>
///          <p>
///             <i>Connections</i> are configurations that you use to connect AWS
///       resources to external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be given to
///       services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party repository such as Bitbucket. For
///       example, you can add the connection in CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a
///       code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and
///       associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection.</p>
///          <p>When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party connection handshake.
///         <i>Installations</i> are the apps that are used to conduct this handshake. For
///       example, the installation for the Bitbucket provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you
///       create a connection, you can choose an existing installation or create one.</p>
///          <p>When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub
///       Enterprise Server, you create a <i>host</i> for your connections.</p>
///          <p>You can work with connections by calling:</p>
///          <ul>
///             <li>
///                <p>
///                   <a>CreateConnection</a>, which creates a uniquely named connection that can be
///           referenced by services such as CodePipeline.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>
///                   <a>DeleteConnection</a>, which deletes the specified connection.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>
///                   <a>GetConnection</a>, which returns information about the connection, including
///           the connection status.</p>
///             </li>

///                <p>

///           account.</p>
///             </li>
///          </ul>
///          <p>You can work with hosts by calling:</p>

///                <p>
///                   <a>CreateHost</a>, which creates a host that represents the infrastructure where your provider is installed.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>
///                   <a>DeleteHost</a>, which deletes the specified host.</p>
///             </li>

///                <p>
///                   <a>GetHost</a>, which returns information about the host, including
///           the setup status.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>

///             </li>
///          </ul>
///          <p>You can work with tags in AWS CodeStar Connections by calling the following:</p>
///          <ul>
///             <li>
///                <p>
///                   <a>ListTagsForResource</a>, which gets information about AWS tags for a
