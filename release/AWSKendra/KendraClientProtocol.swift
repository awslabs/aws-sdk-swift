For example, your index contains top-secret company documents that only certain employees or users should access.

The user still has access to top-secret documents because the user had access when your documents were previously indexed.

You can later update the access control configuration to allow access if the user returns to the company and re-joins the 'top-secret' team. You can re-configure access control for your documents as circumstances change.
