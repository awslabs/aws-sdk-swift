/// <p>When included in a receipt rule, this action publishes a notification to Amazon Simple Notification Service
///             (Amazon SNS). This action includes a complete copy of the email content in the Amazon SNS
///             notifications. Amazon SNS notifications for all other actions simply provide information
///             about the email. They do not include the email content itself.</p>
///         <p>If you own the Amazon SNS topic, you don't need to do anything to give Amazon SES permission to
///             publish emails to it. However, if you don't own the Amazon SNS topic, you need to attach a
///             policy to the topic to give Amazon SES permissions to access it. For information about giving
///             permissions, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/receiving-email-permissions.html">Amazon SES Developer
///                 Guide</a>.</p>

///             <p>You can only publish emails that are 150 KB or less (including the header) to
///                 Amazon SNS. Larger emails will bounce. If you anticipate emails larger than 150 KB, use
///                 the S3 action instead.</p>
