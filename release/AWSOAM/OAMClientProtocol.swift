/// Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage links between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using CloudWatch cross-account observability. With CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze your metrics, logs, and traces in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries. Set up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as monitoring accounts and link them with multiple source accounts. A monitoring account is a central Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with observability data generated from source accounts. A source account is an individual Amazon Web Services account that generates observability data for the resources that reside in it. Source accounts share their observability data with the monitoring account. The shared observability data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and traces in X-Ray.

Before you create a link, you must create a sink in the monitoring account and create a sink policy in that account. The sink policy must permit the source account to link to it. You can grant permission to source accounts by granting permission to an entire organization or to individual accounts. For more information, see [CreateSink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/OAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSink.html) and [PutSinkPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/OAM/latest/APIReference/API_PutSinkPolicy.html).

A sink is a resource that represents an attachment point in a monitoring account. Source accounts can link to the sink to send observability data. After you create a sink, you must create a sink policy that allows source accounts to attach to it. For more information, see [PutSinkPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/OAM/latest/APIReference/API_PutSinkPolicy.html). Each account can contain one sink.

If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.
