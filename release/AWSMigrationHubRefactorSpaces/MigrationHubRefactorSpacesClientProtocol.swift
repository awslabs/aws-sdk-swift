/// Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and other details about each of the actions and data types for Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces (Refactor Spaces). The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see [Amazon Web Services SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).
public protocol MigrationHubRefactorSpacesClientProtocol {
    /// Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces application. The account that owns the environment also owns the applications created inside the environment, regardless of the account that creates the application. Refactor Spaces provisions the Amazon API Gateway and Network Load Balancer for the application proxy inside your account.
    func createApplication(input: CreateApplicationInput) async throws -> CreateApplicationOutputResponse
    /// Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces environment. The caller owns the environment resource, and they are referred to as the environment owner. The environment owner has cross-account visibility and control of Refactor Spaces resources that are added to the environment by other accounts that the environment is shared with. When creating an environment, Refactor Spaces provisions a transit gateway in your account.
    func createEnvironment(input: CreateEnvironmentInput) async throws -> CreateEnvironmentOutputResponse
    /// Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces route. The account owner of the service resource is always the environment owner, regardless of which account creates the route. Routes target a service in the application. If an application does not have any routes, then the first route must be created as a DEFAULTRouteType. When you create a route, Refactor Spaces configures the Amazon API Gateway to send traffic to the target service as follows:
    ///
    /// * If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a private IP address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic using the API Gateway VPC link.
    ///
    /// * If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a public IP address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic over the public internet.
    ///
    /// * If the service has an Lambda function endpoint, then Refactor Spaces uses the API Gateway Lambda integration.
    ///
    ///
    /// A health check is performed on the service when the route is created. If the health check fails, the route transitions to FAILED, and no traffic is sent to the service. For Lambda functions, the Lambda function state is checked. If the function is not active, the function configuration is updated so that Lambda resources are provisioned. If the Lambda state is Failed, then the route creation fails. For more information, see the [GetFunctionConfiguration's State response parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunctionConfiguration.html#SSS-GetFunctionConfiguration-response-State) in the Lambda Developer Guide. For public URLs, a connection is opened to the public endpoint. If the URL is not reachable, the health check fails. For private URLs, a target group is created and the target group health check is run. The HealthCheckProtocol, HealthCheckPort, and HealthCheckPath are the same protocol, port, and path specified in the URL or health URL, if used. All other settings use the default values, as described in [Health checks for your target groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html). The health check is considered successful if at least one target within the target group transitions to a healthy state.

    /// Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service. The account owner of the service is always the environment owner, regardless of which account in the environment creates the service. Services have either a URL endpoint in a virtual private cloud (VPC), or a Lambda function endpoint. If an Amazon Web Services resourceis launched in a service VPC, and you want it to be accessible to all of an environment’s services with VPCs and routes, apply the RefactorSpacesSecurityGroup to the resource. Alternatively, to add more cross-account constraints, apply your own security group.
