/// <p>An object that defines the tags associated with an application.
///          A <i>tag</i> is a label that you optionally define and associate with
///          an application. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as
///          by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.</p>
///          <p>Each tag consists of a required <i>tag key</i> and an
///          associated <i>tag value</i>, both of which you define. A tag key is a
///          general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as
///          a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag
///          value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters,
///          digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following
///          additional restrictions apply to tags:</p>
///          <ul>
///             <li>
///                <p>Tag keys and values are case sensitive.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only
///                one value.</p>
///             </li>
