/// <p>A collection of server process configurations that describe the set of processes to
///             run on each instance in a fleet. Server processes run either an executable in a custom
///             game build or a Realtime Servers script. GameLift launches the configured processes, manages their
///             life cycle, and replaces them as needed. Each instance checks regularly for an updated
///             runtime configuration. </p>
///         <p>A GameLift instance is limited to 50 processes running concurrently. To calculate the
///             total number of processes in a runtime configuration, add the values of the
