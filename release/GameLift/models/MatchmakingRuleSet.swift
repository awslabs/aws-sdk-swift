/// <p>Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine how to build your player
///             matches. Each rule set describes a type of group to be created and defines the
///             parameters for acceptable player matches. Rule sets are used in <a>MatchmakingConfiguration</a> objects.</p>
///         <p>A rule set may define the following elements for a match. For detailed information
///             and examples showing how to construct a rule set, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-rulesets.html">Build a FlexMatch rule

///         <ul>
///             <li>
///                 <p>Teams -- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the
///                     match and set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might
///                     describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled. </p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player
///                     characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that
///                     use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute
///                     values. For example, an attribute might specify a player's skill or
///                     level.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a
///                     match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for
///                     individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require
///                     each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player
///                     in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may
///                     describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at
///                     least one player in a certain role. </p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a
///                     period of time when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you
///                     balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of
///                     making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you
///                     might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players
///                     after 30 seconds.</p>
