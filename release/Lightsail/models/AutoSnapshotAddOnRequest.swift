/// <p>Describes a request to enable or modify the automatic snapshot add-on for an
///       Amazon Lightsail instance or disk.</p>
///          <p>When you modify the automatic snapshot time for a resource, it is typically effective
///       immediately except under the following conditions:</p>
///          <ul>
///             <li>
///                <p>If an automatic snapshot has been created for the current day, and you change the
///           snapshot time to a later time of day, then the new snapshot time will be effective the
///           following day. This ensures that two snapshots are not created for the current day.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                <p>If an automatic snapshot has not yet been created for the current day, and you change
///           the snapshot time to an earlier time of day, then the new snapshot time will be effective
///           the following day and a snapshot is automatically created at the previously set time for
///           the current day. This ensures that a snapshot is created for the current day.</p>
///             </li>

///                <p>If an automatic snapshot has not yet been created for the current day, and you change
///           the snapshot time to a time that is within 30 minutes from your current time, then the new
///           snapshot time will be effective the following day and a snapshot is automatically created
///           at the previously set time for the current day. This ensures that a snapshot is created
///           for the current day, because 30 minutes is required between your current time and the new

///           time for the current day. This ensures that a snapshot is created for the current day,
