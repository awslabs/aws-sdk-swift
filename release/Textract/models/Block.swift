/// <p>A <code>Block</code> represents items that are recognized in a document within a group
///          of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a <code>Block</code> object
///          depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example <a>DetectDocumentText</a>), you get information about the detected words and lines
///          of text. In text analysis (for example <a>AnalyzeDocument</a>), you can also get
///          information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the
///          document.</p>
///          <p>An array of <code>Block</code> objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous
///          operations. In synchronous operations, such as <a>DetectDocumentText</a>, the
///          array of <code>Block</code> objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous
///          operations, such as <a>GetDocumentAnalysis</a>, the array is returned over one
///          or more responses.</p>
