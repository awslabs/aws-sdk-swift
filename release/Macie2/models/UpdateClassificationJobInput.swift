Otherwise, Macie resumes the job according to the schedule and other settings for the job.</p></li> <li><p>USER_PAUSED - Pauses the job temporarily. This value is valid only if the job's current status is IDLE, PAUSED, or RUNNING. If you specify this value and the job's current status is RUNNING, Macie immediately begins to pause all processing tasks for the job.</p> <p>If you pause a one-time job and you don't resume it within 30 days, the job expires and Macie cancels the job. If you pause a recurring job when its status is RUNNING and you don't resume it within 30 days, the job run expires and Macie cancels the run.
