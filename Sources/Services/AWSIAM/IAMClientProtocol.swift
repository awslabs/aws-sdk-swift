The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider. If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see [Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) in the IAM User Guide.

    /// You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP you want to use to access Amazon Web Services.

These OIDC IdPs include Auth0, GitHub, Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation. The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the [CreateOpenIDConnectProvider] operation to highly privileged users.

Before you call this operation, confirm that the role has no active sessions and that any resources used by the role in the linked service are deleted. If you call this operation more than once for the same service-linked role and an earlier deletion task is not complete, then the DeletionTaskId of the earlier request is returned. If you submit a deletion request for a service-linked role whose linked service is still accessing a resource, then the deletion task fails.

To delete the service-linked role, you must first remove those resources from the linked service and then submit the deletion request again.

Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the decode method of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality. An IAM user can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a user, use [GetPolicy] to determine the policy's default version. Then use [GetPolicyVersion] to retrieve the policy document. For more information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the IAM User Guide.

Although each user is limited to a small number of keys, you can still paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters. If the UserName is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. If a temporary access key is used, then UserName is required. If a long-term key is assigned to the user, then UserName is not required. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users. To ensure the security of your Amazon Web Services account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation.

    /// Simulate how a set of IAM policies and optionally a resource-based policy works with a list of API operations and Amazon Web Services resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The policies are provided as strings. The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account. If you want to simulate existing policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role, use [SimulatePrincipalPolicy] instead. Context keys are variables that are maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services and which provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the Condition element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use [GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy]. If the output is long, you can use MaxItems and Marker parameters to paginate the results. The IAM policy simulator evaluates statements in the identity-based policy and the inputs that you provide during simulation. The policy simulator results can differ from your live Amazon Web Services environment. We recommend that you check your policies against your live Amazon Web Services environment after testing using the policy simulator to confirm that you have the desired results.

The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.) Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate does change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated. Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Auth0, GitHub, Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation. Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint operation to highly privileged users.

    /// Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is Active. For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate, see [Managing server certificates in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the IAM User Guide. If the UserName is not specified, the IAM user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users. Because the body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling UploadSigningCertificate. For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see [Signing Amazon Web Services API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see [Making query requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html) in the IAM User Guide.
