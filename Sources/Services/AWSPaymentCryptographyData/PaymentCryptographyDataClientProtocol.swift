In asymmetric decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography decrypts the ciphertext using the private component of the asymmetric encryption key pair. For data encryption outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, you can export the public component of the asymmetric key pair by calling [GetPublicCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKeyCertificate.html). For symmetric and DUKPT decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports TDES and AES algorithms. For asymmetric decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports RSA. When you use DUKPT, for TDES algorithm, the ciphertext data length must be a multiple of 16 bytes. For AES algorithm, the ciphertext data length must be a multiple of 32 bytes.

For more information, see [Translate PIN data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/translate-pin-data.html) in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. PIN block translation involves changing the encrytion of PIN block from one encryption key to another encryption key and changing PIN block format from one to another without PIN block data leaving Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The encryption key transformation can be from PEK (Pin Encryption Key) to BDK (Base Derivation Key) for DUKPT or from BDK for DUKPT to PEK. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports TDES and AES key derivation type for DUKPT tranlations. You can use this operation for P2PE (Point to Point Encryption) use cases where the encryption keys should change but the processing system either does not need to, or is not permitted to, decrypt the data. The allowed combinations of PIN block format translations are guided by PCI. It is important to note that not all encrypted PIN block formats (example, format 1) require PAN (Primary Account Number) as input. And as such, PIN block format that requires PAN (example, formats 0,3,4) cannot be translated to a format (format 1) that does not require a PAN for generation.

ARQC generation is done outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography and is typically generated on a point of sale terminal for an EMV chip card to obtain payment authorization during transaction time.
