For SoftDelete (default), feature columns are set to null and the record is no longer retrievable by GetRecord or BatchGetRecord. For HardDelete, the complete Record is removed from the OnlineStore. In both cases, Feature Store appends the deleted record marker to the OfflineStore with feature values set to null, is_deleted value set to True, and EventTime set to the delete input EventTime. Note that the EventTime specified in DeleteRecord should be set later than the EventTime of the existing record in the OnlineStore for that RecordIdentifer. If it is not, the deletion does not occur:
    ///
    /// * For SoftDelete, the existing (undeleted) record remains in the OnlineStore, though the delete record marker is still written to the OfflineStore.
    ///
    /// * HardDelete returns EventTime: 400 ValidationException to indicate that the delete operation failed. No delete record marker is written to the OfflineStore.

    /// The PutRecord API is used to ingest a list of Records into your feature group. If a new record’s EventTime is greater, the new record is written to both the OnlineStore and OfflineStore. Otherwise, the record is a historic record and it is written only to the OfflineStore. You can specify the ingestion to be applied to the OnlineStore, OfflineStore, or both by using the TargetStores request parameter. You can set the ingested record to expire at a given time to live (TTL) duration after the record’s event time, ExpiresAt = EventTime + TtlDuration, by specifying the TtlDuration parameter. A record level TtlDuration is set when specifying the TtlDuration parameter using the PutRecord API call. If the input TtlDuration is null or unspecified, TtlDuration is set to the default feature group level TtlDuration. A record level TtlDuration supersedes the group level TtlDuration.
