/// CloudFormation CloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying Amazon Web Services infrastructure. With CloudFormation, you declare all your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you. For more information about CloudFormation, see the [CloudFormation product page](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). CloudFormation makes use of other Amazon Web Services products. If you need additional technical information about a specific Amazon Web Services product, you can find the product's technical documentation at [docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).

By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state), and then try to update the stack again. A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when CloudFormation can't roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you might have a stack that's rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.

You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack. To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the ChangeSetType parameter, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE for the ChangeSetType parameter. To create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT for the ChangeSetType parameter. After the CreateChangeSet call successfully completes, CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the [DescribeChangeSet] action. When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by using the [ExecuteChangeSet] action. CloudFormation doesn't make changes until you execute the change set. To create a change set for the entire stack hierarchy, set IncludeNestedStacks to True.

    /// Detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has drifted, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For each resource in the stack that supports drift detection, CloudFormation compares the actual configuration of the resource with its expected template configuration. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are checked for drift. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources differ from their expected template configurations. For more information, see [Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html). Use DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all supported resources for a given stack, or [DetectStackResourceDrift] to detect drift on individual resources. For a list of stack resources that currently support drift detection, see [Resources that Support Drift Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift-resource-list.html). DetectStackDrift can take up to several minutes, depending on the number of resources contained within the stack. Use [DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus] to monitor the progress of a detect stack drift operation. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use [DescribeStackResourceDrifts] to return drift information about the stack and its resources. When detecting drift on a stack, CloudFormation doesn't detect drift on any nested stacks belonging to that stack. Perform DetectStackDrift directly on the nested stack itself.

DetectStackSetDrift returns the OperationId of the stack set drift detection operation.

    /// For more information, see [Testing your public extension prior to publishing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/publish-extension.html#publish-extension-testing) in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide. If you don't specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default version of the extension in your account and Region for testing. To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified when the type was registered. For more information, see [RegisterType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html). Once you've initiated testing on an extension using TestType, you can pass the returned TypeVersionArn into [DescribeType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html) to monitor the current test status and test status description for the extension. An extension must have a test status of PASSED before it can be published. For more information, see [Publishing extensions to make them available for public use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-publish.html) in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide.

A stack instance refers to a stack in a specific account and Region. You can only update stack instances in Amazon Web Services Regions and accounts where they already exist; to create additional stack instances, use [CreateStackInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStackInstances.html). During stack set updates, any parameters overridden for a stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only update the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use [UpdateStackSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html) to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use [UpdateStackSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html) to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using UpdateStackInstances.
