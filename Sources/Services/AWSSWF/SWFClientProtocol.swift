/// Amazon Simple Workflow Service The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state. This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the [Amazon SWF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/) .

The decisions argument specifies the list of decisions made while processing the task. A DecisionTaskCompleted event is added to the workflow history. The executionContext specified is attached to the event in the workflow execution history. Access Control If an IAM policy grants permission to use RespondDecisionTaskCompleted, it can express permissions for the list of decisions in the decisions parameter. Each of the decisions has one or more parameters, much like a regular API call. To allow for policies to be as readable as possible, you can express permissions on decisions as if they were actual API calls, including applying conditions to some parameters.
