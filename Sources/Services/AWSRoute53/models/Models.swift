For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront distribution. You can get the value of DnsName using the CLI command [describe-vpc-endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html). CloudFront distribution Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution. Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is acme.example.com, your CloudFront distribution must include acme.example.com as one of the alternate domain names. For more information, see [Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a CloudFront distribution. For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution. Elastic Beanstalk environment If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name my-environment.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com is a regionalized domain name. For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment. For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the CNAME attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME attribute:
        ///
        /// * Amazon Web Services Management Console: For information about how to get the value by using the console, see [Using Custom Domains with Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html) in the Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide.
        ///
        /// * Elastic Beanstalk API: Use the DescribeEnvironments action to get the value of the CNAME attribute. For more information, see [DescribeEnvironments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html) in the Elastic Beanstalk API Reference.
        ///

Another Route 53 resource record set Specify the value of the Name element for a resource record set in the current hosted zone. If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of Type is CNAME. This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for an alias record.

Note the following: CloudFront distributions You can't set EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is a CloudFront distribution. Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in DNSName and the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any. If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements. ELB load balancers Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
        ///
        /// * Classic Load Balancers: If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in DNSName, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer.

S3 buckets There are no special requirements for setting EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is an S3 bucket. Other records in the same hosted zone If the Amazon Web Services resource that you specify in DNSName is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target.

A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid. The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the Common Name field and possibly several more in the Subject Alternative Names field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName. If the endpoint responds to the client_hello message with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in FullyQualifiedDomainName, a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit FullyQualifiedDomainName from the client_hello message.

        public var failureThreshold: Swift.Int?
        /// Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress. If you specify a value for IPAddress: Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks. When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:
        ///
        /// * If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.
        ///
        /// * If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.
        ///
        /// * If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.
        ///
        ///
        /// If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the preceding cases. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress: Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify for RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error. If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com). In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable. In addition, if the value that you specify for Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.
        public var fullyQualifiedDomainName: Swift.String?
        /// The number of child health checks that are associated with a CALCULATED health check that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the CALCULATED health check to be considered healthy.

For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111, create a resource record set with a Type of A and a ContinentCode of AF. If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource. You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location. The value * in the CountryCode element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements. Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is *. Two groups of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in this record: queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location.

If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

For information about different record types and how data is encoded for them, see [Supported DNS Resource Record Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html) in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Valid values for basic resource record sets: A | AAAA | CAA | CNAME | DS |MX | NAPTR | NS | PTR | SOA | SPF | SRV | TXT Values for weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource record sets: A | AAAA | CAA | CNAME | MX | NAPTR | PTR | SPF | SRV | TXT. When creating a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, specify the same value for all of the resource record sets in the group. Valid values for multivalue answer resource record sets: A | AAAA | MX | NAPTR | PTR | SPF | SRV | TXT SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages. However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets for which the value of Type is SPF. RFC 7208, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1, has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mechanism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperability issues. Accordingly, its use is no longer appropriate for SPF version 1; implementations are not to use it." In RFC 7208, see section 14.1, [The SPF DNS Record Type](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1). Values for alias resource record sets:
        ///
        /// * Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs: A
        ///
        /// * CloudFront distributions: A If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create two resource record sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with a value of A and one with a value of AAAA.

        ///

        ///
        /// * Another resource record set in this hosted zone: Specify the type of the resource record set that you're creating the alias for. All values are supported except NS and SOA. If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of Type is CNAME. This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for an alias record.
        /// This member is required.

        /// Weighted resource record sets only: Among resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:
        ///
        /// * You must specify a value for the Weight element for every weighted resource record set.
        ///
        /// * You can only specify one ResourceRecord per weighted resource record set.
        ///
        /// * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements as weighted resource record sets.
        ///
        /// * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements.
        ///
        /// * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set Weight to 0 for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set Weight to 0 for all resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting Weight to 0 is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets.

This allows the endpoint to respond to HTTPS health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate. Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name in the client_hello message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be SSL alert handshake_failure. A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid. The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the Common Name field and possibly several more in the Subject Alternative Names field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName. If the endpoint responds to the client_hello message with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in FullyQualifiedDomainName, a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit FullyQualifiedDomainName from the client_hello message.

If you don't specify a value for FailureThreshold, the default value is three health checks.
    public var failureThreshold: Swift.Int?
    /// Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress. If a health check already has a value for IPAddress, you can change the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add or remove the value of IPAddress. If you specify a value for IPAddress: Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks. When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:
    ///
    /// * If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.
    ///
    /// * If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.
    ///
    /// * If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.
    ///
    ///
    /// If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the above cases. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress: If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, you can’t update the health check to remove the FullyQualifiedDomainName; if you don’t specify a value for IPAddress on creation, a FullyQualifiedDomainName is required. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error. If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com). In this configuration, if the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable. In addition, if the value of Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.
    public var fullyQualifiedDomainName: Swift.String?
    /// The ID for the health check for which you want detailed information. When you created the health check, CreateHealthCheck returned the ID in the response, in the HealthCheckId element.

We recommend that you use GetHealthCheck or ListHealthChecks to get the current value of HealthCheckVersion for the health check that you want to update, and that you include that value in your UpdateHealthCheck request. This prevents Route 53 from overwriting an intervening update:
    ///
    /// * If the value in the UpdateHealthCheck request matches the value of HealthCheckVersion in the health check, Route 53 updates the health check with the new settings.
    ///

If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IP address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress:
    ///
    /// * IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44.
    ///
    /// * IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345.
