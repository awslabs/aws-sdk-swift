/// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch console. Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon Web Services CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK. You can use CloudWatch Logs to:
///
/// * Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real time: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it can send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.
///
/// * Monitor CloudTrail logged events: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to perform troubleshooting.
///
/// * Archive log data: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so that any log events earlier than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.
public protocol CloudWatchLogsClientProtocol {
    /// Associates the specified KMS key with either one log group in the account, or with all stored CloudWatch Logs query insights results in the account. When you use AssociateKmsKey, you specify either the logGroupName parameter or the resourceIdentifier parameter. You can't specify both of those parameters in the same operation.
    ///
    /// * Specify the logGroupName parameter to cause all log events stored in the log group to be encrypted with that key. Only the log events ingested after the key is associated are encrypted with that key. Associating a KMS key with a log group overrides any existing associations between the log group and a KMS key. After a KMS key is associated with a log group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the KMS key. This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the KMS key is still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested. Associating a key with a log group does not cause the results of queries of that log group to be encrypted with that key. To have query results encrypted with a KMS key, you must use an AssociateKmsKey operation with the resourceIdentifier parameter that specifies a query-result resource.
    ///
    /// * Specify the resourceIdentifier parameter with a query-result resource, to use that key to encrypt the stored results of all future [StartQuery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_StartQuery.html) operations in the account. The response from a [GetQueryResults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetQueryResults.html) operation will still return the query results in plain text. Even if you have not associated a key with your query results, the query results are encrypted when stored, using the default CloudWatch Logs method. If you run a query from a monitoring account that queries logs in a source account, the query results key from the monitoring account, if any, is used.
    ///
    ///

For more information, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html). It can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect. If you attempt to associate a KMS key with a log group but the KMS key does not exist or the KMS key is disabled, you receive an InvalidParameterException error.

    /// Creates an export task so that you can efficiently export data from a log group to an Amazon S3 bucket. When you perform a CreateExportTask operation, you must use credentials that have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify as the destination. Exporting log data to S3 buckets that are encrypted by KMS is supported. Exporting log data to Amazon S3 buckets that have S3 Object Lock enabled with a retention period is also supported. Exporting to S3 buckets that are encrypted with AES-256 is supported. This is an asynchronous call. If all the required information is provided, this operation initiates an export task and responds with the ID of the task. After the task has started, you can use [DescribeExportTasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeExportTasks.html) to get the status of the export task. Each account can only have one active (RUNNING or PENDING) export task at a time. To cancel an export task, use [CancelExportTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CancelExportTask.html). You can export logs from multiple log groups or multiple time ranges to the same S3 bucket. To separate log data for each export task, specify a prefix to be used as the Amazon S3 key prefix for all exported objects. Time-based sorting on chunks of log data inside an exported file is not guaranteed. You can sort the exported log field data by using Linux utilities.

To illustrate, imagine that you change a log group to have a longer retention setting when it contains log events that are past the expiration date, but haven’t been deleted. Those log events will take up to 72 hours to be deleted after the new retention date is reached. To make sure that log data is deleted permanently, keep a log group at its lower retention setting until 72 hours after the previous retention period ends. Alternatively, wait to change the retention setting until you confirm that the earlier log events are deleted. When log events reach their retention setting they are marked for deletion. After they are marked for deletion, they do not add to your archival storage costs anymore, even if they are not actually deleted until later. These log events marked for deletion are also not included when you use an API to retrieve the storedBytes value to see how many bytes a log group is storing.

    /// Schedules a query of a log group using CloudWatch Logs Insights. You specify the log group and time range to query and the query string to use. For more information, see [CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html). After you run a query using StartQuery, the query results are stored by CloudWatch Logs. You can use [GetQueryResults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetQueryResults.html) to retrieve the results of a query, using the queryId that StartQuery returns. If you have associated a KMS key with the query results in this account, then [StartQuery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_StartQuery.html) uses that key to encrypt the results when it stores them. If no key is associated with query results, the query results are encrypted with the default CloudWatch Logs encryption method. Queries time out after 60 minutes of runtime. If your queries are timing out, reduce the time range being searched or partition your query into a number of queries. If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account to start a query in a linked source account. For more information, see [CloudWatch cross-account observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html). For a cross-account StartQuery operation, the query definition must be defined in the monitoring account. You can have up to 30 concurrent CloudWatch Logs insights queries, including queries that have been added to dashboards.

To list the tags for a log group, use [ListTagsForResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_ListTagsForResource.html).

CloudWatch Logs doesn’t support IAM policies that prevent users from assigning specified tags to log groups using the aws:Resource/key-name  or aws:TagKeys condition keys. For more information about using tags to control access, see [Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html).

Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can use the TagResource action with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch Logs resource.
