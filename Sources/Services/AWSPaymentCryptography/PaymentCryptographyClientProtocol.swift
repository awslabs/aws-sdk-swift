/// Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane APIs manage encryption keys for use during payment-related cryptographic operations. You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For more information, see [Identity and access management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/security-iam.html) in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. To use encryption keys for payment-related transaction processing and associated cryptographic operations, you use the [Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/DataAPIReference/Welcome.html). You can perform actions like encrypt, decrypt, generate, and verify payment-related data. All Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend you always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail for control plane operations, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. If you don't conﬁgure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more information, see the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/).

    /// Creates an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, a logical representation of a cryptographic key, that is unique in your account and Amazon Web Services Region. You use keys for cryptographic functions such as encryption and decryption. In addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key includes metadata such as the key ARN, key usage, key origin, creation date, description, and key state. When you create a key, you specify both immutable and mutable data about the key. The immutable data contains key attributes that define the scope and cryptographic operations that you can perform using the key, for example key class (example: SYMMETRIC_KEY), key algorithm (example: TDES_2KEY), key usage (example: TR31_P0_PIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY) and key modes of use (example: Encrypt). For information about valid combinations of key attributes, see [Understanding key attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-validattributes.html) in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. The mutable data contained within a key includes usage timestamp and key deletion timestamp and can be modified after creation. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography binds key attributes to keys using key blocks when you store or export them. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography stores the key contents wrapped and never stores or transmits them in the clear.

Because key deletion is destructive, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography has a safety mechanism to prevent accidental deletion of a key.

    ///
    /// Exports a key from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography simplifies key exchange by replacing the existing paper-based approach with a modern electronic approach. With ExportKey you can export symmetric keys using either symmetric and asymmetric key exchange mechanisms. Using this operation, you can share your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography generated keys with other service partners to perform cryptographic operations outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography For symmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses the ANSI X9 TR-31 norm in accordance with PCI PIN guidelines. And for asymmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ANSI X9 TR-34 norm . Asymmetric key exchange methods are typically used to establish bi-directional trust between the two parties exhanging keys and are used for initial key exchange such as Key Encryption Key (KEK). After which you can export working keys using symmetric method to perform various cryptographic operations within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The TR-34 norm is intended for exchanging 3DES keys only and keys are imported in a WrappedKeyBlock format. Key attributes (such as KeyUsage, KeyAlgorithm, KeyModesOfUse, Exportability) are contained within the key block. You can also use ExportKey functionality to generate and export an IPEK (Initial Pin Encryption Key) from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography using either TR-31 or TR-34 export key exchange. IPEK is generated from BDK (Base Derivation Key) and ExportDukptInitialKey attribute KSN (KeySerialNumber). The generated IPEK does not persist within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography and has to be re-generated each time during export. To export KEK or IPEK using TR-34 Using this operation, you can export initial key using TR-34 asymmetric key exchange. You can only export KEK generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Device (KRD). During key export process, KDH is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography which initiates key export and KRD is the user receiving the key. To initiate TR-34 key export, the KRD must obtain an export token by calling [GetParametersForExport]. This operation also generates a key pair for the purpose of key export, signs the key and returns back the signing public key certificate (also known as KDH signing certificate) and root certificate chain. The KDH uses the private key to sign the the export payload and the signing public key certificate is provided to KRD to verify the signature. The KRD can import the root certificate into its Hardware Security Module (HSM), as required. The export token and the associated KDH signing certificate expires after 7 days. Next the KRD generates a key pair for the the purpose of encrypting the KDH key and provides the public key cerificate (also known as KRD wrapping certificate) back to KDH. The KRD will also import the root cerificate chain into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling [ImportKey] for RootCertificatePublicKey. The KDH, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, will use the KRD wrapping cerificate to encrypt (wrap) the key under export and signs it with signing private key to generate a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock. For more information on TR-34 key export, see section [Exporting symmetric keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-export.html) in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. Set the following parameters:
    ///
    /// * ExportAttributes: Specify export attributes in case of IPEK export. This parameter is optional for KEK export.
    ///
    /// * ExportKeyIdentifier: The KeyARN of the KEK or BDK (in case of IPEK) under export.

    ///
    /// * KeyMaterial: Use Tr31KeyBlock parameters.
