/// Backup gateway Backup gateway connects Backup to your hypervisor, so you can create, store, and restore backups of your virtual machines (VMs) anywhere, whether on-premises or in the VMware Cloud (VMC) on Amazon Web Services. Add on-premises resources by connecting to a hypervisor through a gateway. Backup will automatically discover the resources in your hypervisor. Use Backup to assign virtual or on-premises resources to a backup plan, or run on-demand backups. Once you have backed up your resources, you can view them and restore them like any resource supported by Backup. To download the Amazon Web Services software to get started, navigate to the Backup console, choose Gateways, then choose Create gateway.
