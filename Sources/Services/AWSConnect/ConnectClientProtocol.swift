/// Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer engagement at any scale. Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable you to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more efficiently by getting customers in touch with the appropriate agents. There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can create. There are also limits to the number of requests that you can make per second. For more information, see [Amazon Connect Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html) in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. You can connect programmatically to an Amazon Web Services service by using an endpoint. For a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see [Amazon Connect Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html).

If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently during a 30 day period, contact us for a service quota exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming and releasing any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired. By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number of active phone numbers during any 30 day period. If you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 30 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired. For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99, claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.

If you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 30 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired. For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99, claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit.
