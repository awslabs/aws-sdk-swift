The Direct Connect Partner can use an interconnect to provide Direct Connect hosted connections to customers through their own network services. Like a standard connection, an interconnect links the partner's network to an Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end is connected to the partner's router, the other to an Direct Connect router. You can automatically add the new interconnect to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new interconnect is allocated on the same Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect is created. For each end customer, the Direct Connect Partner provisions a connection on their interconnect by calling [AllocateHostedConnection]. The end customer can then connect to Amazon Web Services resources by creating a virtual interface on their connection, using the VLAN assigned to them by the Direct Connect Partner.

All connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth (either 1Gbps or 10Gbps) and must terminate at the same Direct Connect endpoint. You can have up to 10 dedicated connections per LAG. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than Direct Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created. You can specify an existing physical dedicated connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical dedicated connection, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the same Direct Connect endpoint to which the dedicated connection terminates. Any virtual interfaces associated with the dedicated connection are automatically disassociated and re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change. If the Amazon Web Services account used to create a LAG is a registered Direct Connect Partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to host sub-connections.

For example, if you use the default ASN 64512 for both your the transit gateway and Direct Connect gateway, the association request fails. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 8500 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames.
