/// This is the Proton Service API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax and usage examples for each of the [actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html) and [data types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html) for the Proton service. The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response. Alternatively, you can use the Amazon Web Services CLI to access an API. For more information, see the [Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html). The Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create service templates to provide standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in turn, select from the available service templates to automate their application or service deployments. Because administrators define the infrastructure and tooling that Proton deploys and manages, they need permissions to use all of the listed API operations. When developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, Proton deploys their applications. To monitor their applications that are running on Proton, developers need permissions to the service create, list, update and delete API operations and the service instance list and update API operations. To learn more about Proton, see the [Proton User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/Welcome.html). Ensuring Idempotency When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete, even if the request already returned a result. This might make it difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended. Idempotency ensures that an API request action completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain updated information, such as the current creation status. The following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure idempotency. Idempotent create APIs with a client token The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a client token. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the request. We recommend that you don't reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs. Given a request action that has succeeded: If you retry the request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response. If you retry the request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are different, the retry throws a ValidationException with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error. Client tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with the expired token, a new resource is created. If the original resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is created. Idempotent create APIs with a client token:

/// Idempotent create APIs Given a request action that has succeeded: If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original resource hasn't been modified, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.

If you retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a ValidationException with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error. Idempotent create APIs:

You can't update or connect the environment to an environment account connection if it isn't already associated with an environment connection.

CURRENT_VERSION In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the new spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are updated. Don’t include minor or major version parameters when you use this deployment-type. MINOR_VERSION In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor version of the current major version in use. MAJOR_VERSION In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the current template, by default. You can also specify a different major version that's higher than the major version in use and a minor version.
