    ///
    /// * The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.
    ///
    /// * A propertyAlias, which is a data stream alias (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature). To define an asset property's alias, see [UpdateAssetProperty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetProperty.html).

IoT SiteWise rejects timestamps outside of the inclusive range of [-7 days, +10 minutes] and returns a TimestampOutOfRangeException error. For each asset property, IoT SiteWise overwrites TQVs with duplicate timestamps unless the newer TQV has a different quality. For example, if you store a TQV {T1, GOOD, V1}, then storing {T1, GOOD, V2} replaces the existing TQV. IoT SiteWise authorizes access to each BatchPutAssetPropertyValue entry individually.
