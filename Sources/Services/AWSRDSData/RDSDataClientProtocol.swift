/// Amazon RDS Data Service Amazon RDS provides an HTTP endpoint to run SQL statements on an Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. To run these statements, you work with the Data Service API. The Data Service API isn't supported on Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 DB clusters. For more information about the Data Service API, see [Using the Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html) in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.
public protocol RDSDataClientProtocol {
    /// Runs a batch SQL statement over an array of data. You can run bulk update and insert operations for multiple records using a DML statement with different parameter sets. Bulk operations can provide a significant performance improvement over individual insert and update operations. If a call isn't part of a transaction because it doesn't include the transactionID parameter, changes that result from the call are committed automatically. There isn't a fixed upper limit on the number of parameter sets. However, the maximum size of the HTTP request submitted through the Data API is 4 MiB. If the request exceeds this limit, the Data API returns an error and doesn't process the request. This 4-MiB limit includes the size of the HTTP headers and the JSON notation in the request. Thus, the number of parameter sets that you can include depends on a combination of factors, such as the size of the SQL statement and the size of each parameter set. The response size limit is 1 MiB. If the call returns more than 1 MiB of response data, the call is terminated.
