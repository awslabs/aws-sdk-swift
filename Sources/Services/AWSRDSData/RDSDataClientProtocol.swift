/// RDS Data API Amazon RDS provides an HTTP endpoint to run SQL statements on an Amazon Aurora DB cluster. To run these statements, you use the RDS Data API (Data API). Data API is available with the following types of Aurora databases:
///
/// * Aurora PostgreSQL - Serverless v2, Serverless v1, and provisioned
///
/// * Aurora MySQL - Serverless v1 only
///
///
/// For more information about the Data API, see [Using RDS Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html) in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.
public protocol RDSDataClientProtocol {
    /// Performs the `BatchExecuteStatement` operation on the `RdsDataService` service.
    ///
    /// Runs a batch SQL statement over an array of data. You can run bulk update and insert operations for multiple records using a DML statement with different parameter sets. Bulk operations can provide a significant performance improvement over individual insert and update operations. If a call isn't part of a transaction because it doesn't include the transactionID parameter, changes that result from the call are committed automatically. There isn't a fixed upper limit on the number of parameter sets. However, the maximum size of the HTTP request submitted through the Data API is 4 MiB. If the request exceeds this limit, the Data API returns an error and doesn't process the request. This 4-MiB limit includes the size of the HTTP headers and the JSON notation in the request. Thus, the number of parameter sets that you can include depends on a combination of factors, such as the size of the SQL statement and the size of each parameter set. The response size limit is 1 MiB. If the call returns more than 1 MiB of response data, the call is terminated.
