For a user in a recipient account who is not an Service Catalog Admin, but still has the ability to create Principals (Users/Groups/Roles), that user could create a role that matches a principal name association for the portfolio. Although this user may not know which principal names are associated through Service Catalog, they may be able to guess the user. If this potential escalation path is a concern, then Service Catalog recommends using PrincipalType as IAM.

The CloudFormation stack must have one of the following statuses to be imported: CREATE_COMPLETE, UPDATE_COMPLETE, UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE, IMPORT_COMPLETE, and IMPORT_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE.

When you import an existing CloudFormation stack into a portfolio, constraints that are associated with the product aren't applied during the import process.
