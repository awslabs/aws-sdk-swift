For a user in a recipient account who is not an Service Catalog Admin, but still has the ability to create Principals (Users/Groups/Roles), that user could create a role that matches a principal name association for the portfolio.

The portfolio share cannot be updated if the CreatePortfolioShare operation is IN_PROGRESS, as the share is not available to recipient entities. In this case, you must wait for the portfolio share to be completed. You must provide the accountId or organization node in the input, but not both. If the portfolio is shared to both an external account and an organization node, and both shares need to be updated, you must invoke UpdatePortfolioShare separately for each share type. This API cannot be used for removing the portfolio share. You must use DeletePortfolioShare API for that action. When you associate a principal with portfolio, a potential privilege escalation path may occur when that portfolio is then shared with other accounts. For a user in a recipient account who is not an Service Catalog Admin, but still has the ability to create Principals (Users/Groups/Roles), that user could create a role that matches a principal name association for the portfolio. Although this user may not know which principal names are associated through Service Catalog, they may be able to guess the user. If this potential escalation path is a concern, then Service Catalog recommends using PrincipalType as IAM. With this configuration, the PrincipalARN must already exist in the recipient account before it can be associated.
