/// Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services Cloud where you can launch Amazon Web Services resources in a virtual network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available

With a private NAT gateway, private communication is routed across VPCs and on-premises networks through a transit gateway or virtual private gateway. Common use cases include running large workloads behind a small pool of allowlisted IPv4 addresses, preserving private IPv4 addresses, and communicating between overlapping networks. For more information, see [NAT gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) in the Amazon VPC User Guide. When you create a public NAT gateway and assign it an EIP or secondary EIPs, the network border group of the EIPs must match the network border group of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the public NAT gateway is in. If it's not the same, the NAT gateway will fail to launch. You can see the network border group for the subnet's AZ by viewing the details of the subnet.

You can create snapshots of volumes in a Region and volumes on an Outpost. If you create a snapshot of a volume in a Region, the snapshot must be stored in the same Region as the volume. If you create a snapshot of a volume on an Outpost, the snapshot can be stored on the same Outpost as the volume, or in the Region for that Outpost. When a snapshot is created, any Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot. You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending. When you create a snapshot for an EBS volume that serves as a root device, we recommend that you stop the instance before taking the snapshot. Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated snapshots always remain protected. You can tag your snapshots during creation.

For a dual stack subnet, specify both an IPv4 CIDR block and an IPv6 CIDR block. A subnet CIDR block must not overlap the CIDR block of an existing subnet in the VPC. After you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block. The allowed size for an IPv4 subnet is between a /28 netmask (16 IP addresses) and a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses). Amazon Web Services reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for your use. If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can associate an IPv6 CIDR block with a subnet when you create it. If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle. When you stop an instance in a subnet, it retains its private IPv4 address. It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available.

The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:
    ///
    /// * public: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the all group. All Amazon Web Services accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.
    ///
    /// * explicit: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific Amazon Web Services account.

    ///
    ///
    /// The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions. If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results. If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the OwnerIds option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the Amazon Web Services account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for snapshots owned by Amazon, or self for snapshots that you own. If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Amazon Web Services account IDs (if you own the snapshots), self for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or all for public snapshots. If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable.

    /// Describes the status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event. The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes: Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks might still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see [Monitor the status of your volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. Events: Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data. Actions: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the [EnableVolumeIO] action and then check the volume for data consistency. Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

If you delete or disable the customer managed KMS key that you specified for use with encryption by default, your instances will fail to launch. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

If your EBS volume is attached to a current-generation EC2 instance type, you might be able to apply these changes without stopping the instance or detaching the volume from it. For more information about modifying EBS volumes, see [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html) (Linux instances) or [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html) (Windows instances). When you complete a resize operation on your volume, you need to extend the volume's file-system size to take advantage of the new storage capacity. For more information, see [Extend a Linux file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-linux) or [Extend a Windows file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-windows). You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/). You can also track the status of a modification using [DescribeVolumesModifications]. For information about tracking status changes using either method, see [Monitor the progress of volume modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-modifications.html). With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume might require detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance. After modifying a volume, you must wait at least six hours and ensure that the volume is in the in-use or available state before you can modify the same volume. This is sometimes referred to as a cooldown period.

You can check the state of your instance using [DescribeInstances]. You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see [CreateTags] and [Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html). Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more information, see [Key pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html). For troubleshooting, see [What to do if an instance immediately terminates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_InstanceStraightToTerminated.html), and [Troubleshooting connecting to your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html).

For instances based on Intel and AMD processors, the interrupt is received as a non-maskable interrupt (NMI). In general, the operating system crashes and reboots when a kernel panic or stop error is triggered. The operating system can also be configured to perform diagnostic tasks, such as generating a memory dump file, loading a secondary kernel, or obtaining a call trace. Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its operating system is configured to perform the required diagnostic tasks. For more information about configuring your operating system to generate a crash dump when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see [Send a diagnostic interrupt (for advanced users)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html) (Linux instances) or [Send a diagnostic interrupt (for advanced users)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html) (Windows instances).

For more information, see [Stop and start your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

For more information, see [Hibernate your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. We don't charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage. You can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances. You can't use the Stop action to hibernate Spot Instances, but you can specify that Amazon EC2 should hibernate Spot Instances when they are interrupted. For more information, see [Hibernating interrupted Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html#hibernate-spot-instances) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs. Stopping and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see [Instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer.
