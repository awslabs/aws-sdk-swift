/// Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra workloads in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the Amazon Web Services Management Console or a few lines of code, you can create keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any infrastructure or installing software. In addition to supporting Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via open-source Cassandra drivers, Amazon Keyspaces supports data definition language (DDL) operations to manage keyspaces and tables using the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, as well as infrastructure as code (IaC) services and tools such as CloudFormation and Terraform. This API reference describes the supported DDL operations in detail. For the list of all supported CQL APIs, see [Supported Cassandra APIs, operations, and data types in Amazon Keyspaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/cassandra-apis.html) in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. To learn how Amazon Keyspaces API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see [Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html#service-name-info-in-cloudtrail) in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. For more information about Amazon Web Services APIs, for example how to implement retry logic or how to sign Amazon Web Services API requests, see [Amazon Web Services APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html) in the General Reference.

For more information about restore points, see [ Time window for PITR continuous backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/PointInTimeRecovery_HowItWorks.html#howitworks_backup_window) in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. Any number of users can execute up to 4 concurrent restores (any type of restore) in a given account. When you restore using point in time recovery, Amazon Keyspaces restores your source table's schema and data to the state based on the selected timestamp (day:hour:minute:second) to a new table. The Time to Live (TTL) settings are also restored to the state based on the selected timestamp. In addition to the table's schema, data, and TTL settings, RestoreTable restores the capacity mode, encryption, and point-in-time recovery settings from the source table. Unlike the table's schema data and TTL settings, which are restored based on the selected timestamp, these settings are always restored based on the table's settings as of the current time or when the table was deleted. You can also overwrite these settings during restore:
    ///
    /// * Read/write capacity mode
    ///
    /// * Provisioned throughput capacity settings
    ///
    /// * Point-in-time (PITR) settings

    /// For more information, see [PITR restore settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/PointInTimeRecovery_HowItWorks.html#howitworks_backup_settings) in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. Note that the following settings are not restored, and you must configure them manually for the new table:
    ///
    /// * Automatic scaling policies (for tables that use provisioned capacity mode)

    /// * Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
