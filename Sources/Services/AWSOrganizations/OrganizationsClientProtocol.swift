/// Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an organization and centrally manage your accounts and their resources. This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For more information about using this service, see the [Organizations User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html). Support and feedback for Organizations We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to [feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com](mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com) or post your feedback and questions in the [Organizations support forum](http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219). For more information about the Amazon Web Services support forums, see [Forums Help](http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa). Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK For the current release of Organizations, specify the us-east-1 region for all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the Amazon Web Services Regions in China, then specify cn-northwest-1. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:
///
/// * Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region: --endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China) or --endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)
///
/// * Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command: aws configure set default.region us-east-1 (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China) or aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1 (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)
///
/// * Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint: --region us-east-1 (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China) or --region cn-northwest-1 (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)

/// Recording API Requests Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see [Logging Organizations API calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration) in the Organizations User Guide.

The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the [TagResource] operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists. You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see [Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html) in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide. Calling CreateGovCloudAccount is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because CreateGovCloudAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:
    ///
    /// * Use the OperationId response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the [DescribeCreateAccountStatus] operation.
    ///
    /// * Check the CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event.

    ///
    ///
    /// When you call the CreateGovCloudAccount action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see [Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html) in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.
