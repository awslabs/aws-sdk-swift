For more information, see [Organizations and service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs) in the Organizations User Guide. Amazon Web Services automatically enables CloudTrail for Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:
    ///
    /// * Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.
    ///
    /// * Create an Amazon S3 bucket for CloudTrail log storage. For more information, see [Verifying CloudTrail Is Enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/verifying-cloudtrail.html) in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.
    ///
    ///
    /// If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource permission. The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the [TagResource] operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists. You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see [Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html) in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide. Calling CreateGovCloudAccount is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because CreateGovCloudAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:
    ///
    /// * Use the OperationId response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the [DescribeCreateAccountStatus] operation.
    ///
    /// * Check the CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see [Logging and monitoring in Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html) in the Organizations User Guide.
    ///
    ///
    /// When you call the CreateGovCloudAccount action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see [Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html) in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.

    /// * When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account is not automatically collected.

When you disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a [service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in new accounts in your organization. This means the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations. We strongly recommend that you don't use this command to disable integration between Organizations and the specified Amazon Web Services service. Instead, use the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. This lets the trusted service perform any required initialization when enabling trusted access, such as creating any required resources and any required clean up of resources when disabling trusted access. For information about how to disable trusted service access to your organization using the trusted service, see the Learn more link under the Supports Trusted Access column at [Amazon Web Services services that you can use with Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html). on this page.

This includes any data aggregation from the member accounts to the management account, or to a delegated administrator account, where relevant.
    ///
    /// * Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data or resources related to the integration, while other services stop accessing the organization but leave any historical data and configuration in place to support a possible re-enabling of the integration.
    ///
    ///
    /// Using the other service's console or commands to disable the integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other Amazon Web Services service. After you perform the DisableAWSServiceAccess operation, the specified service can no longer perform operations in your organization's accounts For more information about integrating other services with Organizations, including the list of services that work with Organizations, see [Using Organizations with other Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html) in the Organizations User Guide.

Until you enable all features, you have access only to consolidated billing, and you can't use any of the advanced account administration features that Organizations supports. For more information, see [Enabling all features in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html) in the Organizations User Guide. This operation is required only for organizations that were created explicitly with only the consolidated billing features enabled. Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in the organization. The feature set change can be finalized and the additional features enabled only after all administrators in the invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake. After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable individual policy types in a root using [EnablePolicyType] and [DisablePolicyType]. To see the status of policy types in a root, use [ListRoots]. After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize the feature set change by accepting the handshake that contains "Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES". This completes the change. After you enable all features in your organization, the management account in the organization can apply policies on all member accounts. These policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those accounts can do. The management account can apply policies that prevent accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account administrators are aware of this. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.

You can undo this by using the [DisablePolicyType] operation. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Amazon Web Services recommends that you first use [ListRoots] to see the status of policy types for a specified root, and then use this operation. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an Amazon Web Services service. You can enable a policy type in a root only if that policy type is available in the organization. To view the status of available policy types in the organization, use [DescribeOrganization].
