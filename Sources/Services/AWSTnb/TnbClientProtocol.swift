For more information, see [Network instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tnb/latest/ug/network-instances.html) in the Amazon Web Services Telco Network Builder User Guide. A network package consists of a network service descriptor (NSD) file (required) and any additional files (optional), such as scripts specific to your needs. For example, if you have multiple function packages in your network package, you can use the NSD to define which network functions should run in certain VPCs, subnets, or EKS clusters. This request creates an empty network package container with an ID. Once you create a network package, you can upload the network package content using [PutSolNetworkPackageContent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tnb/latest/APIReference/API_PutSolNetworkPackageContent.html).
