/// Amazon Connect is an easy-to-use omnichannel cloud contact center service that enables companies of any size to deliver superior customer service at a lower cost. Amazon Connect communications capabilities make it easy for companies to deliver personalized interactions across communication channels, including chat. Use the Amazon Connect Participant Service to manage participants (for example, agents, customers, and managers listening in), and to send messages and events within a chat contact. The APIs in the service enable the following: sending chat messages, attachment sharing, managing a participant's connection state and message events, and retrieving chat transcripts.

ConnectionToken is used for invoking this API instead of ParticipantToken.

    /// Creates the participant's connection. ParticipantToken is used for invoking this API instead of ConnectionToken. The participant token is valid for the lifetime of the participant – until they are part of a contact. The response URL for WEBSOCKET Type has a connect expiry timeout of 100s. Clients must manually connect to the returned websocket URL and subscribe to the desired topic. For chat, you need to publish the following on the established websocket connection: {"topic":"aws/subscribe","content":{"topics":["aws/chat"]}} Upon websocket URL expiry, as specified in the response ConnectionExpiry parameter, clients need to call this API again to obtain a new websocket URL and perform the same steps as before. Message streaming support: This API can also be used together with the [StartContactStreaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartContactStreaming.html) API to create a participant connection for chat contacts that are not using a websocket. For more information about message streaming, [Enable real-time chat message streaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/chat-message-streaming.html) in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. Feature specifications: For information about feature specifications, such as the allowed number of open websocket connections per participant, see [Feature specifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#feature-limits) in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. The Amazon Connect Participant Service APIs do not use [Signature Version 4 authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
