/// Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data types, and errors. Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so that you can continually audit your Amazon Web Services usage. You can use it to assess the effectiveness of your controls, manage risk, and simplify compliance. Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate assessments for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls to support internal audits with specific requirements. Use the following links to get started with the Audit Manager API:

    func deregisterAccount(input: DeregisterAccountInput) async throws -> DeregisterAccountOutput
    /// Removes the specified Amazon Web Services account as a delegated administrator for Audit Manager. When you remove a delegated administrator from your Audit Manager settings, you continue to have access to the evidence that you previously collected under that account. This is also the case when you deregister a delegated administrator from Organizations. However, Audit Manager stops collecting and attaching evidence to that delegated administrator account moving forward. Keep in mind the following cleanup task if you use evidence finder: Before you use your management account to remove a delegated administrator, make sure that the current delegated administrator account signs in to Audit Manager and disables evidence finder first. Disabling evidence finder automatically deletes the event data store that was created in their account when they enabled evidence finder. If this task isn’t completed, the event data store remains in their account. In this case, we recommend that the original delegated administrator goes to CloudTrail Lake and manually [deletes the event data store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-eds-disable-termination.html). This cleanup task is necessary to ensure that you don't end up with multiple event data stores. Audit Manager ignores an unused event data store after you remove or change a delegated administrator account. However, the unused event data store continues to incur storage costs from CloudTrail Lake if you don't delete it. When you deregister a delegated administrator account for Audit Manager, the data for that account isn’t deleted. If you want to delete resource data for a delegated administrator account, you must perform that task separately before you deregister the account. Either, you can do this in the Audit Manager console. Or, you can use one of the delete API operations that are provided by Audit Manager. To delete your Audit Manager resource data, see the following instructions:
