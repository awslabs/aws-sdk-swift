/// Database Migration Service Database Migration Service (DMS) can migrate your data to and from the most widely used commercial and open-source databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora, MySQL, and SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE). The service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to MySQL or SQL Server to PostgreSQL. For more information about DMS, see [What Is Database Migration Service?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

    /// Migrates 10 active and enabled Amazon SNS subscriptions at a time and converts them to corresponding Amazon EventBridge rules. By default, this operation migrates subscriptions only when all your replication instance versions are 3.4.5 or higher. If any replication instances are from versions earlier than 3.4.5, the operation raises an error and tells you to upgrade these instances to version 3.4.5 or higher. To enable migration regardless of version, set the Force option to true. However, if you don't upgrade instances earlier than version 3.4.5, some types of events might not be available when you use Amazon EventBridge. To call this operation, make sure that you have certain permissions added to your user account. For more information, see [Migrating event subscriptions to Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Events.html#CHAP_Events-migrate-to-eventbridge) in the Amazon Web Services Database Migration Service User Guide.
