/// AWS OpsWorks Welcome to the AWS OpsWorks Stacks API Reference. This guide provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for AWS OpsWorks Stacks actions and data types, including common parameters and error codes. AWS OpsWorks Stacks is an application management service that provides an integrated experience for overseeing the complete application lifecycle. For information about this product, go to the [AWS OpsWorks](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/) details page. SDKs and CLI The most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks Stacks API is by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to implement applications in your preferred language.

/// Chef Versions When you call [CreateStack], [CloneStack], or [UpdateStack] we recommend you use the ConfigurationManager parameter to specify the Chef version. The recommended and default value for Linux stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see [Chef Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html). You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks to Chef 12 as soon as possible.
