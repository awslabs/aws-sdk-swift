        /// MaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only) The maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the buffer is specified by BufferSize. Specify a value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality of the video. BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only) The maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you're using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize, Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate. InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only) The interlace mode for the output video. Interlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a video by interlacing two fields (one field on every other line, the other field on the other lines) so that the human eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images and flickering. Valid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bottom), TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom field first), and Auto. If InterlaceMode is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses Progressive for the output. If Auto is specified, Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output. ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only) The color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store information about how to render color. Bt.601 is the standard for standard definition video, while Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video. Valid values include None, Bt709toBt601, Bt601toBt709, and Auto. If you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your output is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 50, or 60, your SegmentDuration is null, and you are using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:
        ///
        /// * Standard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709
        ///

        ///
        ///
        /// Elastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the ColorspaceConversionModeAuto mode in the future. All outputs in a playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConversionMode. If you do not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode, Elastic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to your output file, you can check the AppliedColorSpaceConversion parameter included in your job response. If your job does not have an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied. ChromaSubsampling The sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p. yuv420p samples the chroma information of every other horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples the color information of every horizontal line and every other vertical line. LoopCount (Gif Only) The number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values include Infinite and integers between 0 and 100, inclusive.

Key frames are fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality. For Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant ratio to the KeyframesMaxDist. This allows Smooth playlists to switch between different quality levels while the file is being played. For example, an input file can have a FrameRate of 30 with a KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs to have a ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameRate of 30, 25, and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively. Alternately, this can be achieved by setting FrameRate to auto and having the same values for MaxFrameRate and KeyframesMaxDist.
