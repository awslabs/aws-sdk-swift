/// This is the AWS HealthImaging API Reference. AWS HealthImaging is a HIPAA-eligible service that helps health care providers and their medical imaging ISV partners store, transform, and apply machine learning to medical images. For an introduction to the service, see the [ AWS HealthImaging Developer Guide ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/healthimaging/latest/devguide/what-is.html). We recommend using one of the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) for your programming language, as they take care of request authentication, serialization, and connection management. For more information, see [Tools to build on AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools). For information about using HealthImaging API actions in one of the language-specific AWS SDKs, refer to the See Also link at the end of each section that describes an API action or data type. The following sections list AWS HealthImaging API actions categorized according to functionality. Links are provided to actions within this Reference, along with links back to corresponding sections in the AWS HealthImaging Developer Guide where you can view console procedures and CLI/SDK code examples.
