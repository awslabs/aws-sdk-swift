/// Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify anomalous behavior in business critical operational applications. You specify the Amazon Web Services resources that you want DevOps Guru to cover, then the Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon Web Services CloudTrail events related to those resources are analyzed. When anomalous behavior is detected, DevOps Guru creates an insight that includes recommendations, related events, and related metrics that can help you improve your operational applications. For more information, see [What is Amazon DevOps Guru](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html). You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are notified every time a new insight is created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to generate an OpsItem in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for each insight to help you manage and track your work addressing insights. To learn about the DevOps Guru workflow, see [How DevOps Guru works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html#how-it-works). To learn about DevOps Guru concepts, see [Concepts in DevOps Guru](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/concepts.html).

If you use an Amazon SNS topic in another account, you must attach a policy to it that grants DevOps Guru permission to send it notifications. DevOps Guru adds the required policy on your behalf to send notifications using Amazon SNS in your account. DevOps Guru only supports standard SNS topics. For more information, see [Permissions for Amazon SNS topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/sns-required-permissions.html). If you use an Amazon SNS topic that is encrypted by an Amazon Web Services Key Management Service customer-managed key (CMK), then you must add permissions to the CMK. For more information, see [Permissions for Amazon Web Services KMSâ€“encrypted Amazon SNS topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/sns-kms-permissions.html).
