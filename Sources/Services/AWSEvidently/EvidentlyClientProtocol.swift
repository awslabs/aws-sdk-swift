Evidently then checks the evaluation rules and assigns the variation. The first rules that are evaluated are the override rules.

Next, if there is a launch of the feature, the user might be assigned to a variation in the launch. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that launch. If the user is enrolled in the launch, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the various feature variations used for the launch.

The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that experiment.

If the user is not assigned to a launch or experiment, they are served the default variation.

Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can use the TagResource action with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html).
