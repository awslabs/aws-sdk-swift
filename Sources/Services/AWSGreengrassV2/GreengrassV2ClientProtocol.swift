/// IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use Lambda functions and components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation. IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this API reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components, manage deployments, and core devices. For more information, see [What is IoT Greengrass?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html) in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

For more information, see [Configure cloud discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/configure-cloud-discovery.html) in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide. Client devices are local IoT devices that connect to and communicate with an IoT Greengrass core device over MQTT. You can connect client devices to a core device to sync MQTT messages and data to Amazon Web Services IoT Core and interact with client devices in Greengrass components.

When you create a new deployment for a target that has an existing deployment, you replace the previous deployment. IoT Greengrass applies the new deployment to the target devices. Every deployment has a revision number that indicates how many deployment revisions you define for a target. Use this operation to create a new revision of an existing deployment.

For example, this occurs if component A requires version >2.0.0 and component B requires version <2.0.0 of a component dependency. When you specify the component candidates to resolve, IoT Greengrass compares each component's digest from the core device with the component's digest in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the digests don't match, then IoT Greengrass specifies to use the version from the Amazon Web Services Cloud.
