/// IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use Lambda functions and components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation. IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this API reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components, manage deployments, and core devices. For more information, see [What is IoT Greengrass?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html) in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

For more information, see [Configure cloud discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/configure-cloud-discovery.html) in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide. Client devices are local IoT devices that connect to and communicate with an IoT Greengrass core device over MQTT. You can connect client devices to a core device to sync MQTT messages and data to Amazon Web Services IoT Core and interact with client devices in Greengrass components.

    /// Retrieves a paginated list of the components that a Greengrass core device runs. By default, this list doesn't include components that are deployed as dependencies of other components. To include dependencies in the response, set the topologyFilter parameter to ALL. IoT Greengrass relies on individual devices to send status updates to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass Core software isn't running on the device, or if device isn't connected to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that device might not reflect its current status. The status timestamp indicates when the device status was last updated. Core devices send status updates at the following times:
    ///
    /// * When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts

    /// * When the core device receives a deployment from the Amazon Web Services Cloud

    /// Retrieves a list of components that meet the component, version, and platform requirements of a deployment. Greengrass core devices call this operation when they receive a deployment to identify the components to install. This operation identifies components that meet all dependency requirements for a deployment. If the requirements conflict, then this operation returns an error and the deployment fails. For example, this occurs if component A requires version >2.0.0 and component B requires version <2.0.0 of a component dependency. When you specify the component candidates to resolve, IoT Greengrass compares each component's digest from the core device with the component's digest in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the digests don't match, then IoT Greengrass specifies to use the version from the Amazon Web Services Cloud. To use this operation, you must use the data plane API endpoint and authenticate with an IoT device certificate. For more information, see [IoT Greengrass endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/greengrass.html).
