/// Amazon EMR on EKS provides a deployment option for Amazon EMR that allows you to run open-source big data frameworks on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). With this deployment option, you can focus on running analytics workloads while Amazon EMR on EKS builds, configures, and manages containers for open-source applications. For more information about Amazon EMR on EKS concepts and tasks, see [What is shared id="EMR-EKS"/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/emr-eks.html). Amazon EMR containers is the API name for Amazon EMR on EKS. The emr-containers prefix is used in the following scenarios:
///
/// * It is the prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, aws emr-containers start-job-run.
///
/// * It is the prefix before IAM policy actions for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, "Action": [ "emr-containers:StartJobRun"]. For more information, see [Policy actions for Amazon EMR on EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions).
///
/// * It is the prefix used in Amazon EMR on EKS service endpoints. For example, emr-containers.us-east-2.amazonaws.com. For more information, see [Amazon EMR on EKSService Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/service-quotas.html#service-endpoints).

Tags enable you to categorize your Amazon Web Services resources by attributes such as purpose, owner, or environment. When you have many resources of the same type, you can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it. For example, you can define a set of tags for your Amazon EMR on EKS clusters to help you track each cluster's owner and stack level. We recommend that you devise a consistent set of tag keys for each resource type. You can then search and filter the resources based on the tags that you add.
