    /// Adds one or more tags to an ACM certificate. Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You specify the certificate on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You specify the tag by using a key-value pair. You can apply a tag to just one certificate if you want to identify a specific characteristic of that certificate, or you can apply the same tag to multiple certificates if you want to filter for a common relationship among those certificates. Similarly, you can apply the same tag to multiple resources if you want to specify a relationship among those resources. For example, you can add the same tag to an ACM certificate and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to indicate that they are both used by the same website. For more information, see [Tagging ACM certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/tags.html). To remove one or more tags, use the [RemoveTagsFromCertificate] action. To view all of the tags that have been applied to the certificate, use the [ListTagsForCertificate] action.

Note that [integrated services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html) allow only certificate types and keys they support to be associated with their resources. Further, their support differs depending on whether the certificate is imported into IAM or into ACM. For more information, see the documentation for each service. For more information about importing certificates into ACM, see [Importing Certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html) in the Certificate Manager User Guide. ACM does not provide [managed renewal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html) for certificates that you import. Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:
    ///
    /// * You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.
    ///
    /// * The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.
    ///
    /// * The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5,120 bytes).
    ///
    /// * If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its certificate chain.
    ///
    /// * If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain.
    ///
    /// * The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.
    ///
    /// * The current time must be between the Not Before and Not After certificate fields.
    ///
    /// * The Issuer field must not be empty.
    ///
    /// * The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.
    ///
    /// * To import a new certificate, omit the CertificateArn argument. Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.
    ///
    /// * When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names preceded by fileb://. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the C:\temp folder as fileb://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs.
    ///
    /// * When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner required by the programming language you're using.
    ///
    /// * The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the algorithm of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key type is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA.

If you are requesting a public certificate, each domain name that you specify must be validated to verify that you own or control the domain. You can use [DNS validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html) or [email validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html).

ACM behavior differs from the [RFC 6125](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125#appendix-B.2) specification of the certificate validation process. ACM first checks for a Subject Alternative Name, and, if it finds one, ignores the common name (CN).
