With this operation you can move an alias that's already in use on a CloudFront distribution to a different distribution in one step. This prevents the downtime that could occur if you first remove the alias from one distribution and then separately add the alias to another distribution. To use this operation to associate an alias with a distribution, you provide the alias and the ID of the target distribution for the alias. For more information, including how to set up the target distribution, prerequisites that you must complete, and other restrictions, see [Moving an alternate domain name to a different distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#alternate-domain-names-move) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
