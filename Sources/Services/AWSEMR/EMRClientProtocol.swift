    /// AddJobFlowSteps adds new steps to a running cluster. A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow. If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using SSH to connect to the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop. A step specifies the location of a JAR file stored either on the master node of the cluster or in Amazon S3. Each step is performed by the main function of the main class of the JAR file. The main class can be specified either in the manifest of the JAR or by using the MainFunction parameter of the step. Amazon EMR executes each step in the order listed. For a step to be considered complete, the main function must exit with a zero exit code and all Hadoop jobs started while the step was running must have completed and run successfully. You can only add steps to a cluster that is in one of the following states: STARTING, BOOTSTRAPPING, RUNNING, or WAITING. The string values passed into HadoopJarStep object cannot exceed a total of 10240 characters.

    /// RunJobFlow creates and starts running a new cluster (job flow). The cluster runs the steps specified. After the steps complete, the cluster stops and the HDFS partition is lost. To prevent loss of data, configure the last step of the job flow to store results in Amazon S3. If the [JobFlowInstancesConfig]KeepJobFlowAliveWhenNoSteps parameter is set to TRUE, the cluster transitions to the WAITING state rather than shutting down after the steps have completed. For additional protection, you can set the [JobFlowInstancesConfig]TerminationProtected parameter to TRUE to lock the cluster and prevent it from being terminated by API call, user intervention, or in the event of a job flow error. A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow. If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using the SSH shell to connect to the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop. For long-running clusters, we recommend that you periodically store your results. The instance fleets configuration is available only in Amazon EMR releases 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions. The RunJobFlow request can contain InstanceFleets parameters or InstanceGroups parameters, but not both.

The cluster still terminates upon successful completion of the job flow. Calling SetTerminationProtection on a cluster is similar to calling the Amazon EC2 DisableAPITermination API on all Amazon EC2 instances in a cluster. SetTerminationProtection is used to prevent accidental termination of a cluster and to ensure that in the event of an error, the instances persist so that you can recover any data stored in their ephemeral instance storage. To terminate a cluster that has been locked by setting SetTerminationProtection to true, you must first unlock the job flow by a subsequent call to SetTerminationProtection in which you set the value to false.
