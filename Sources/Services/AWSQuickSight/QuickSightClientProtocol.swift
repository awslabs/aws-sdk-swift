    /// Creates Amazon QuickSight customizations for the current Amazon Web Services Region. Currently, you can add a custom default theme by using the CreateAccountCustomization or UpdateAccountCustomization API operation. To further customize Amazon QuickSight by removing Amazon QuickSight sample assets and videos for all new users, see [Customizing Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/customizing-quicksight.html) in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide. You can create customizations for your Amazon Web Services account or, if you specify a namespace, for a QuickSight namespace instead. Customizations that apply to a namespace always override customizations that apply to an Amazon Web Services account. To find out which customizations apply, use the DescribeAccountCustomization API operation. Before you use the CreateAccountCustomization API operation to add a theme as the namespace default, make sure that you first share the theme with the namespace. If you don't share it with the namespace, the theme isn't visible to your users even if you make it the default theme. To check if the theme is shared, view the current permissions by using the [DescribeThemePermissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeThemePermissions.html) API operation. To share the theme, grant permissions by using the [UpdateThemePermissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateThemePermissions.html) API operation.

This operation isn't supported in the US East (Ohio) Region, South America (Sao Paulo) Region, or Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region. Before you use this operation, make sure that you can connect to an existing Amazon Web Services account. If you don't have an Amazon Web Services account, see [Sign up for Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/setting-up-aws-sign-up.html) in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide. The person who signs up for Amazon QuickSight needs to have the correct Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. For more information, see [IAM Policy Examples for Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/iam-policy-examples.html) in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide. If your IAM policy includes both the Subscribe and CreateAccountSubscription actions, make sure that both actions are set to Allow. If either action is set to Deny, the Deny action prevails and your API call fails. You can't pass an existing IAM role to access other Amazon Web Services services using this API operation. To pass your existing IAM role to Amazon QuickSight, see [Passing IAM roles to Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security-create-iam-role) in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide. You can't set default resource access on the new account from the Amazon QuickSight API. Instead, add default resource access from the Amazon QuickSight console. For more information about setting default resource access to Amazon Web Services services, see [Setting default resource access to Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/scoping-policies-defaults.html) in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide.

    ///
    /// * Amazon Web Services account - The Amazon Web Services account exists at the top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services Services. When you subscribe to Amazon QuickSight, you choose one Amazon Web Services Region to use as your home Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use Amazon QuickSight in any supported Amazon Web Services Region.
    ///
    /// * Amazon Web Services Region - In each Amazon Web Services Region where you sign in to Amazon QuickSight at least once, Amazon QuickSight acts as a separate instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to Amazon QuickSight in any Amazon Web Services Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace. To run the command in a different Amazon Web Services Region, you change your Region settings. If you're using the CLI, you can use one of the following options:
    ///
    /// * Use [command line options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html).
    ///
    /// * Use [named profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html).
    ///
    /// * Run aws configure to change your default Amazon Web Services Region. Use Enter to key the same settings for your keys. For more information, see [Configuring the CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
    ///
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// * Namespace - A QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region.

Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an Amazon Web Services account. All settings are isolated to a single Amazon Web Services Region. To apply them in other Amazon Web Services Regions, run the CreateAccountCustomization command in each Amazon Web Services Region where you want to apply the same customizations.
