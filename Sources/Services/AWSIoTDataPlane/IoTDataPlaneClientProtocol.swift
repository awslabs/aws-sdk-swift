/// IoT data IoT data enables secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. It implements a broker for applications and things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish) and retrieve, update, and delete shadows. A shadow is a persistent representation of your things and their state in the Amazon Web Services cloud. Find the endpoint address for actions in IoT data by running this CLI command: aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS The service name used by [Amazon Web ServicesSignature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) to sign requests is: iotdevicegateway.
