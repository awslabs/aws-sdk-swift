/// Cloud9 Cloud9 is a collection of tools that you can use to code, build, run, test, debug, and release software in the cloud. For more information about Cloud9, see the [Cloud9 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide). Cloud9 supports these operations:
///
/// * CreateEnvironmentEC2: Creates an Cloud9 development environment, launches an Amazon EC2 instance, and then connects from the instance to the environment.
///
/// * CreateEnvironmentMembership: Adds an environment member to an environment.
///
/// * DeleteEnvironment: Deletes an environment. If an Amazon EC2 instance is connected to the environment, also terminates the instance.
///
/// * DeleteEnvironmentMembership: Deletes an environment member from an environment.
///
/// * DescribeEnvironmentMemberships: Gets information about environment members for an environment.
///
/// * DescribeEnvironments: Gets information about environments.
///
/// * DescribeEnvironmentStatus: Gets status information for an environment.
///
/// * ListEnvironments: Gets a list of environment identifiers.
///
/// * ListTagsForResource: Gets the tags for an environment.
///
/// * TagResource: Adds tags to an environment.
///
/// * UntagResource: Removes tags from an environment.
///
/// * UpdateEnvironment: Changes the settings of an existing environment.
///
/// * UpdateEnvironmentMembership: Changes the settings of an existing environment member for an environment.
