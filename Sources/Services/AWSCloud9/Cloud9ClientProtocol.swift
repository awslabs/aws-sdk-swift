///
/// * CreateEnvironmentMembership: Adds an environment member to an environment.
///
/// * DeleteEnvironment: Deletes an environment. If an Amazon EC2 instance is connected to the environment, also terminates the instance.
///
/// * DeleteEnvironmentMembership: Deletes an environment member from an environment.
///
/// * DescribeEnvironmentMemberships: Gets information about environment members for an environment.
///
/// * DescribeEnvironments: Gets information about environments.
///
/// * DescribeEnvironmentStatus: Gets status information for an environment.
///
/// * ListEnvironments: Gets a list of environment identifiers.
