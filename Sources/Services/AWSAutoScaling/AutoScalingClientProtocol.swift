If you are no longer using a scheduled action, you can delete it by calling the [DeleteScheduledAction] API. If you try to schedule your action in the past, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling returns an error message.

Whenever your application needs to scale out, the Auto Scaling group can draw on the warm pool to meet its new desired capacity. For more information and example configurations, see [Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html) in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. This operation must be called from the Region in which the Auto Scaling group was created. This operation cannot be called on an Auto Scaling group that has a mixed instances policy or a launch template or launch configuration that requests Spot Instances.

This operation is part of the [instance refresh feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html) in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group after you make configuration changes. A rollback is not supported in the following situations:

    /// Starts an instance refresh. During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling performs a rolling update of instances in an Auto Scaling group. Instances are terminated first and then replaced, which temporarily reduces the capacity available within your Auto Scaling group. This operation is part of the [instance refresh feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html) in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group. This feature is helpful, for example, when you have a new AMI or a new user data script. You just need to create a new launch template that specifies the new AMI or user data script. Then start an instance refresh to immediately begin the process of updating instances in the group. If successful, the request's response contains a unique ID that you can use to track the progress of the instance refresh. To query its status, call the [DescribeInstanceRefreshes] API. To describe the instance refreshes that have already run, call the [DescribeInstanceRefreshes] API. To cancel an instance refresh that is in progress, use the [CancelInstanceRefresh] API. An instance refresh might fail for several reasons, such as EC2 launch failures, misconfigured health checks, or not ignoring or allowing the termination of instances that are in Standby state or protected from scale in. You can monitor for failed EC2 launches using the scaling activities. To find the scaling activities, call the [DescribeScalingActivities] API. If you enable auto rollback, your Auto Scaling group will be rolled back automatically when the instance refresh fails. You can enable this feature before starting an instance refresh by specifying the AutoRollback property in the instance refresh preferences. Otherwise, to roll back an instance refresh before it finishes, use the [RollbackInstanceRefresh] API.

    /// Terminates the specified instance and optionally adjusts the desired group size. This operation cannot be called on instances in a warm pool. This call simply makes a termination request. The instance is not terminated immediately. When an instance is terminated, the instance status changes to terminated. You can't connect to or start an instance after you've terminated it. If you do not specify the option to decrement the desired capacity, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are terminated. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling balances instances across all Availability Zones. If you decrement the desired capacity, your Auto Scaling group can become unbalanced between Availability Zones. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tries to rebalance the group, and rebalancing might terminate instances in other zones. For more information, see [Rebalancing activities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-benefits.html#AutoScalingBehavior.InstanceUsage) in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

    /// We strongly recommend that all Auto Scaling groups use launch templates to ensure full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2. Updates the configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group. To update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group and the property that you want to change. Any properties that you don't specify are not changed by this update request. The new settings take effect on any scaling activities after this call returns. If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to run with the configuration that they were originally launched with. When you update a group to specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your application. Note the following about changing DesiredCapacity, MaxSize, or MinSize:
    ///
    /// * If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new DesiredCapacity value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate.
    ///
    /// * If you specify a new value for MinSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MinSize is larger than the current size of the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the new MinSize value.
    ///
    /// * If you specify a new value for MaxSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MaxSize is smaller than the current size of the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the new MaxSize value.
    ///
    ///
    /// To see which properties have been set, call the [DescribeAutoScalingGroups] API. To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the [DescribePolicies] API. If the group has scaling policies, you can update them by calling the [PutScalingPolicy] API.
