    /// Explainability is only available for Forecasts and Predictors generated from an AutoPredictor ([CreateAutoPredictor]) Creates an Amazon Forecast Explainability. Explainability helps you better understand how the attributes in your datasets impact forecast. Amazon Forecast uses a metric called Impact scores to quantify the relative impact of each attribute and determine whether they increase or decrease forecast values. To enable Forecast Explainability, your predictor must include at least one of the following: related time series, item metadata, or additional datasets like Holidays and the Weather Index. CreateExplainability accepts either a Predictor ARN or Forecast ARN. To receive aggregated Impact scores for all time series and time points in your datasets, provide a Predictor ARN. To receive Impact scores for specific time series and time points, provide a Forecast ARN. CreateExplainability with a Predictor ARN You can only have one Explainability resource per predictor.

To create a predictor that is compatible with all aspects of Forecast, use [CreateAutoPredictor]. Creates an Amazon Forecast predictor. In the request, provide a dataset group and either specify an algorithm or let Amazon Forecast choose an algorithm for you using AutoML. If you specify an algorithm, you also can override algorithm-specific hyperparameters. Amazon Forecast uses the algorithm to train a predictor using the latest version of the datasets in the specified dataset group. You can then generate a forecast using the [CreateForecast] operation. To see the evaluation metrics, use the [GetAccuracyMetrics] operation. You can specify a featurization configuration to fill and aggregate the data fields in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset to improve model training. For more information, see [FeaturizationConfig]. For RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets, CreatePredictor verifies that the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created matches the ForecastFrequency. TARGET_TIME_SERIES datasets don't have this restriction. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp format. For more information, see [howitworks-datasets-groups]. By default, predictors are trained and evaluated at the 0.1 (P10), 0.5 (P50), and 0.9 (P90) quantiles. You can choose custom forecast types to train and evaluate your predictor by setting the ForecastTypes. AutoML If you want Amazon Forecast to evaluate each algorithm and choose the one that minimizes the objective function, set PerformAutoML to true. The objective function is defined as the mean of the weighted losses over the forecast types. By default, these are the p10, p50, and p90 quantile losses.

    /// What-if analysis is a scenario modeling technique where you make a hypothetical change to a time series and compare the forecasts generated by these changes against the baseline, unchanged time series. It is important to remember that the purpose of a what-if analysis is to understand how a forecast can change given different modifications to the baseline time series. For example, imagine you are a clothing retailer who is considering an end of season sale to clear space for new styles. After creating a baseline forecast, you can use a what-if analysis to investigate how different sales tactics might affect your goals. You could create a scenario where everything is given a 25% markdown, and another where everything is given a fixed dollar markdown. You could create a scenario where the sale lasts for one week and another where the sale lasts for one month. With a what-if analysis, you can compare many different scenarios against each other. Note that a what-if analysis is meant to display what the forecasting model has learned and how it will behave in the scenarios that you are evaluating. Do not blindly use the results of the what-if analysis to make business decisions. For instance, forecasts might not be accurate for novel scenarios where there is no reference available to determine whether a forecast is good.
