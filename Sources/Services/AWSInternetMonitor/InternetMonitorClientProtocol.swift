/// Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet issues impact the performance and availability between your applications hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users, reducing the time it takes for you to diagnose these issues, from days to minutes. You can explore internet measurements for different time frames and at different geographic granularities, and quickly visualize the impact of issues, and then take action to improve your end users' experience, for example, by switching to other Amazon Web Services services or rerouting traffic to your workload through differentAmazon Web Services Regions. If the issue is caused by the Amazon Web Services network, you'll automatically receive an Amazon Web Services Health Dashboard notification with the steps that Amazon Web Services is taking to mitigate the problem. To support integrating health information for geographies and networks specific to your application, Internet Monitor delivers measurements to CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Metrics. Internet Monitor also sends health events to Amazon EventBridge, so you can set up notifications. Internet Monitor monitors internet connectivity for your application through Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon WorkSpaces directories. To use Internet Monitor, you create a monitor and add resources to it, Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Amazon CloudFront distributions, or WorkSpaces directories that show where your application's internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides internet measurements from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the locations and networks that communicate with your application. For more information, see [ Using Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html) in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

    /// Creates a monitor in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor. A monitor is built based on information from the application resources that you add: Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Amazon CloudFront distributions, and WorkSpaces directories. After you create a monitor, you can view the internet performance for your application, scoped to a location, as well as any health events that are impairing traffic. Internet Monitor can also diagnose whether the impairment is on the Amazon Web Services network or is an issue with an internet service provider (ISP).
