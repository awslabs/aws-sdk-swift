    /// Uploads position update data for one or more devices to a tracker resource (up to 10 devices per batch). Amazon Location uses the data when it reports the last known device position and position history. Amazon Location retains location data for 30 days. Position updates are handled based on the PositionFiltering property of the tracker. When PositionFiltering is set to TimeBased, updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections, and location data is stored at a maximum of one position per 30 second interval. If your update frequency is more often than every 30 seconds, only one update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID. When PositionFiltering is set to DistanceBased filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than 30 m (98.4 ft). When PositionFiltering is set to AccuracyBased filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than the measured accuracy. For example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is neither stored or evaluated if the device has moved less than 15 m. If PositionFiltering is set to AccuracyBased filtering, Amazon Location uses the default value { "Horizontal": 0} when accuracy is not provided on a DevicePositionUpdate.
