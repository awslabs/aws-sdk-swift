WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power.

    /// A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance. You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie. Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition. For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:
    ///
    /// * IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
    ///
    /// * IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
    ///
    /// * IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
    ///
    /// * IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
    ///
    ///
    /// The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:
    ///
    /// * If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
    ///
    /// * IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
    ///
    /// * IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
    ///
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// * If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
    ///
    /// * HTTP method POST: count 2
    ///
    /// * HTTP method GET: count 2
    ///
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// * If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
    ///
    /// * IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
    ///
    /// * IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
    ///

    ///
    ///
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits individually. You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule. You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside another statement, for example inside a NotStatement or OrStatement. You can define a RateBasedStatement inside a web ACL and inside a rule group. For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the WAF Developer Guide. If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys. This option is not available for other aggregation configurations. WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie. Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition. For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:

        ///

        /// * HTTP method GET: count 2

You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule. You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside another statement, for example inside a NotStatement or OrStatement. You can define a RateBasedStatement inside a web ACL and inside a rule group. For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the WAF Developer Guide. If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys. This option is not available for other aggregation configurations. WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes of the body up to the limit for the web ACL. By default, for regional web ACLs, this limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront web ACLs, this limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront web ACLs, you can increase the limit in the web ACL AssociationConfig, for additional fees. If you know that the request body for your web requests should never exceed the inspection limit, you could use a size constraint statement to block requests that have a larger request body size.
