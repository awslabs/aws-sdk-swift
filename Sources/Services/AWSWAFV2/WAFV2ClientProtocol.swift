/// WAF This is the latest version of the WAF API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements. If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version, see the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response. This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html). You can make calls using the endpoints listed in [WAF endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html).
///
/// * For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.
///
/// * For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.
///
///
/// Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see [Amazon Web Services SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs). We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:
///
/// * You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope parameter and set it to CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL.
///
/// * You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.
///
/// * The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.
public protocol WAFV2ClientProtocol {
    /// Associates a web ACL with a regional application resource, to protect the resource. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. For Amazon CloudFront, don't use this call. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a web ACL, in the CloudFront call UpdateDistribution, set the web ACL ID to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL. For information, see [UpdateDistribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. When you make changes to web ACLs or web ACL components, like rules and rule groups, WAF propagates the changes everywhere that the web ACL and its components are stored and used. Your changes are applied within seconds, but there might be a brief period of inconsistency when the changes have arrived in some places and not in others. So, for example, if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an Amazon Web Services resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds.

    /// Returns the web ACL capacity unit (WCU) requirements for a specified scope and set of rules. You can use this to check the capacity requirements for the rules you want to use in a [RuleGroup] or [WebACL]. WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. For more information, see [WAF web ACL capacity units (WCU)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-waf-capacity-units.html) in the WAF Developer Guide.

The maximum number of addresses that can be blocked for a single rate-based rule instance is 10,000. If more than 10,000 addresses exceed the rate limit, those with the highest rates are blocked. For a rate-based rule that you've defined inside a rule group, provide the name of the rule group reference statement in your request, in addition to the rate-based rule name and the web ACL name. WAF monitors web requests and manages keys independently for each unique combination of web ACL, optional rule group, and rate-based rule. For example, if you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use the rule group in a web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for that web ACL, rule group reference statement, and rate-based rule instance. If you use the same rule group in a second web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for this second usage completely independent of your first.

    /// Updates the specified [WebACL]. While updating a web ACL, WAF provides continuous coverage to the resources that you have associated with the web ACL. This operation completely replaces the mutable specifications that you already have for the web ACL with the ones that you provide to this call. To modify a web ACL, do the following:
    ///
    /// * Retrieve it by calling [GetWebACL]
    ///
    /// * Update its settings as needed
    ///
    /// * Provide the complete web ACL specification to this call
    ///
    ///
    /// When you make changes to web ACLs or web ACL components, like rules and rule groups, WAF propagates the changes everywhere that the web ACL and its components are stored and used. Your changes are applied within seconds, but there might be a brief period of inconsistency when the changes have arrived in some places and not in others. So, for example, if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an Amazon Web Services resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds. A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has a statement that defines what to look for in web requests and an action that WAF applies to requests that match the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types [Rule], [RuleGroup], and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.

    /// - `WAFConfigurationWarningException` : The operation failed because you are inspecting the web request body, headers, or cookies without specifying how to handle oversize components. Rules that inspect the body must either provide an OversizeHandling configuration or they must be preceded by a SizeConstraintStatement that blocks the body content from being too large. Rules that inspect the headers or cookies must provide an OversizeHandling configuration. Provide the handling configuration and retry your operation. Alternately, you can suppress this warning by adding the following tag to the resource that you provide to this operation: Tag (key:WAF:OversizeFieldsHandlingConstraintOptOut, value:true).
    /// - `WAFDuplicateItemException` : WAF couldn’t perform the operation because the resource that you tried to save is a duplicate of an existing one.

    /// - `WAFInternalErrorException` : Your request is valid, but WAF couldn’t perform the operation because of a system problem. Retry your request.
    /// - `WAFInvalidOperationException` : The operation isn't valid.
    /// - `WAFInvalidParameterException` : The operation failed because WAF didn't recognize a parameter in the request. For example:
    ///
    /// * You specified a parameter name or value that isn't valid.
