If you submit an AssociateDRTRole request for an account that already has an associated role, the new RoleArn will replace the existing RoleArn. Prior to making the AssociateDRTRole request, you must attach the AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy managed policy to the role that you'll specify in the request.

You can associate the web ACL through the Shield Advanced console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/). For more information, see [Getting Started with Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/getting-started-ddos.html). You can also associate the web ACL to the resource through the WAF console or the WAF API, but you must manage Shield Advanced automatic mitigation through Shield Advanced. For information about WAF, see [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/).
