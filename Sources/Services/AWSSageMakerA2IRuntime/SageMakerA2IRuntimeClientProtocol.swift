/// Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) adds the benefit of human judgment to any machine learning application. When an AI application can't evaluate data with a high degree of confidence, human reviewers can take over. This human review is called a human review workflow. To create and start a human review workflow, you need three resources: a worker task template, a flow definition, and a human loop. For information about these resources and prerequisites for using Amazon A2I, see [Get Started with Amazon Augmented AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide. This API reference includes information about API actions and data types that you can use to interact with Amazon A2I programmatically. Use this guide to:
///
/// * Start a human loop with the StartHumanLoop operation when using Amazon A2I with a custom task type. To learn more about the difference between custom and built-in task types, see [Use Task Types ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html). To learn how to start a human loop using this API, see [Create and Start a Human Loop for a Custom Task Type ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-start-human-loop.html#a2i-instructions-starthumanloop) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
///
/// * Manage your human loops. You can list all human loops that you have created, describe individual human loops, and stop and delete human loops. To learn more, see [Monitor and Manage Your Human Loop ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-monitor-humanloop-results.html) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.

/// Amazon A2I integrates APIs from various AWS services to create and start human review workflows for those services.
