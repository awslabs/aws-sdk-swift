/// Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances (virtual private servers), container services, storage buckets, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly price. You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, Command Line Interface (CLI), or SDKs. For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli). This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more information about the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service, see [Amazon Lightsail Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

    /// Creates a snapshot of a block storage disk. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data before shutting down a Lightsail instance. You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the snapshot status is pending. You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just define the instance name parameter when issuing the snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to access the data on the disk. The create disk snapshot operation supports tag-based access control via request tags.

The ableToUpdateBundle parameter in the response will indicate whether you can currently update a bucket's bundle. Update a bucket's bundle if it's consistently going over its storage space or data transfer quota, or if a bucket's usage is consistently in the lower range of its storage space or data transfer quota. Due to the unpredictable usage fluctuations that a bucket might experience, we strongly recommend that you update a bucket's bundle only as a long-term strategy, instead of as a short-term, monthly cost-cutting measure. Choose a bucket bundle that will provide the bucket with ample storage space and data transfer for a long time to come.

    /// Allows the update of one or more parameters of a database in Amazon Lightsail. Parameter updates don't cause outages; therefore, their application is not subject to the preferred maintenance window. However, there are two ways in which parameter updates are applied: dynamic or pending-reboot. Parameters marked with a dynamic apply type are applied immediately. Parameters marked with a pending-reboot apply type are applied only after the database is rebooted using the reboot relational database operation. The update relational database parameters operation supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by relationalDatabaseName. For more information, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags).
