/// Amazon Transcribe offers three main types of batch transcription: Standard, Medical, and Call Analytics.
///
/// * Standard transcriptions are the most common option. Refer to for details.
///
/// * Medical transcriptions are tailored to medical professionals and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient dialogue into after-visit notes. Refer to for details.
///
/// * Call Analytics transcriptions are designed for use with call center audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer service calls, use this option. Refer to for details.

    /// Creates a new Call Analytics category. All categories are automatically applied to your Call Analytics transcriptions. Note that in order to apply categories to your transcriptions, you must create them before submitting your transcription request, as categories cannot be applied retroactively. When creating a new category, you can use the InputType parameter to label the category as a POST_CALL or a REAL_TIME category. POST_CALL categories can only be applied to post-call transcriptions and REAL_TIME categories can only be applied to real-time transcriptions. If you do not include InputType, your category is created as a POST_CALL category by default. Call Analytics categories are composed of rules. For each category, you must create between 1 and 20 rules. Rules can include these parameters: , , , and . To update an existing category, see . To learn more about Call Analytics categories, see [Creating categories for post-call transcriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tca-categories-batch.html) and [Creating categories for real-time transcriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tca-categories-stream.html).
