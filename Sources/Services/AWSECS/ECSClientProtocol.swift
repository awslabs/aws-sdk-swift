/// Amazon Elastic Container Service Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service. It makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that's managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or External (on-premises) instances that you manage. Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls. This makes it easy to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features. You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you don't need to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems. You also don't need to worry about scaling your management infrastructure.

These providers are available to all accounts in the Amazon Web Services Regions that Fargate supports.

    /// Runs and maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the desiredCount, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the [UpdateService] action. Starting April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past 30-day period are considered current customers and will be able to continue using the service. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see [Service load balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer. There are two service scheduler strategies available:
    ///
    /// * REPLICA - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains your desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see [Service scheduler concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
    ///
    /// * DAEMON - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks. It also stops tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see [Service scheduler concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
    ///
    ///
    /// You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is initiated by changing properties. For example, the deployment might be initiated by the task definition or by your desired count of a service. This is done with an [UpdateService] operation. The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%. If a service uses the ECS deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of your desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if you set your service to have desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. If they're in the RUNNING state, tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy . If they're in the RUNNING state and reported as healthy by the load balancer, tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy . The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service uses the ECS deployment controller, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%. If a service uses either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state. This is while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used. This is the case even if they're currently visible when describing your service. When creating a service that uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the [CreateTaskSet] operation. For more information, see [Amazon ECS deployment types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement. For information about task placement and task placement strategies, see [Amazon ECS task placement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

When you specify serviceLongArnFormat, taskLongArnFormat, or containerInstanceLongArnFormat, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging. When you specify awsvpcTrunking, the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature is changed. If awsvpcTrunking is turned on, any new container instances that support the feature are launched have the increased ENI limits available to them. For more information, see [Elastic Network Interface Trunking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When you specify containerInsights, the default setting indicating whether Amazon Web Services CloudWatch Container Insights is turned on for your clusters is changed. If containerInsights is turned on, any new clusters that are created will have Container Insights turned on unless you disable it during cluster creation. For more information, see [CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Amazon ECS is introducing tagging authorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for actions that create the resource, such as ecsCreateCluster. If tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the ecs:TagResource action. For more information, see [Grant permission to tag resources on creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/supported-iam-actions-tagging.html) in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide. When Amazon Web Services determines that a security or infrastructure update is needed for an Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate, the tasks need to be stopped and new tasks launched to replace them. Use fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod to configure the wait time to retire a Fargate task. For information about the Fargate tasks maintenance, see [Amazon Web Services Fargate task maintenance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-maintenance.html) in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.

Starting April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past 30-day period are considered current customers and will be able to continue using the service. The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model. This is because of the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command. To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:

A container instance can't be changed to DRAINING until it has reached an ACTIVE status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received.

For services using the rolling update (ECS) you can update the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, load balancers, service registries, enable ECS managed tags option, propagate tags option, task placement constraints and strategies, and task definition. When you update any of these parameters, Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the new configuration. For services using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, health check grace period, task placement constraints and strategies, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, task definition, or load balancer need to be updated, create a new CodeDeploy deployment. For more information, see [CreateDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html) in the CodeDeploy API Reference. For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, health check grace period, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags option, using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, create a new task set For more information, see [CreateTaskSet]. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy. If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, my_image:latest), you don't need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the forceNewDeployment option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start. You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy.

    /// Updates the protection status of a task. You can set protectionEnabled to true to protect your task from termination during scale-in events from [Service Autoscaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-auto-scaling.html) or [deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html). Task-protection, by default, expires after 2 hours at which point Amazon ECS clears the protectionEnabled property making the task eligible for termination by a subsequent scale-in event. You can specify a custom expiration period for task protection from 1 minute to up to 2,880 minutes (48 hours). To specify the custom expiration period, set the expiresInMinutes property. The expiresInMinutes property is always reset when you invoke this operation for a task that already has protectionEnabled set to true. You can keep extending the protection expiration period of a task by invoking this operation repeatedly. To learn more about Amazon ECS task protection, see [Task scale-in protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-scale-in-protection.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide . This operation is only supported for tasks belonging to an Amazon ECS service. Invoking this operation for a standalone task will result in an TASK_NOT_VALID failure. For more information, see [API failure reasons](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/api_failures_messages.html). If you prefer to set task protection from within the container, we recommend using the [Task scale-in protection endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-scale-in-protection-endpoint.html).
