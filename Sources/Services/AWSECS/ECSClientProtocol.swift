/// Amazon Elastic Container Service Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service. It makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that's managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or External (on-premises) instances that you manage. Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls. This makes it easy to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features. You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you don't need to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems. You also don't need to worry about scaling your management infrastructure.

    /// Creates a new capacity provider. Capacity providers are associated with an Amazon ECS cluster and are used in capacity provider strategies to facilitate cluster auto scaling. Only capacity providers that use an Auto Scaling group can be created. Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate use the FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. These providers are available to all accounts in the Amazon Web Services Regions that Fargate supports.

    /// Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a default cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the CreateCluster action. When you call the [CreateCluster] API operation, Amazon ECS attempts to create the Amazon ECS service-linked role for your account. This is so that it can manage required resources in other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. However, if the user that makes the call doesn't have permissions to create the service-linked role, it isn't created. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
    func createCluster(input: CreateClusterInput) async throws -> CreateClusterOutputResponse
    /// Runs and maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the desiredCount, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the [UpdateService] action. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see [Service load balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer. There are two service scheduler strategies available:
    ///
    /// * REPLICA - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains your desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see [Service scheduler concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
    ///
    /// * DAEMON - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks. It also stops tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see [Service scheduler concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
    ///
    ///
    /// You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is initiated by changing properties. For example, the deployment might be initiated by the task definition or by your desired count of a service. This is done with an [UpdateService] operation. The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%. If a service uses the ECS deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of your desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if you set your service to have desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. If they're in the RUNNING state, tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy . If they're in the RUNNING state and reported as healthy by the load balancer, tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy . The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service uses the ECS deployment controller, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%. If a service uses either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state. This is while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used. This is the case even if they're currently visible when describing your service. When creating a service that uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the [CreateTaskSet] operation. For more information, see [Amazon ECS deployment types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement. For information about task placement and task placement strategies, see [Amazon ECS task placement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

Prior to a capacity provider being deleted, the capacity provider must be removed from the capacity provider strategy from all services. The [UpdateService] API can be used to remove a capacity provider from a service's capacity provider strategy. When updating a service, the forceNewDeployment option can be used to ensure that any tasks using the Amazon EC2 instance capacity provided by the capacity provider are transitioned to use the capacity from the remaining capacity providers. Only capacity providers that aren't associated with a cluster can be deleted. To remove a capacity provider from a cluster, you can either use [PutClusterCapacityProviders] or delete the cluster.

When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from ACTIVE to DRAINING, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the [ListServices] API operation. After all tasks have transitioned to either STOPPING or STOPPED status, the service status moves from DRAINING to INACTIVE. Services in the DRAINING or INACTIVE status can still be viewed with the [DescribeServices] API operation. However, in the future, INACTIVE services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and [DescribeServices] calls on those services return a ServiceNotFoundException error. If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing service in either ACTIVE or DRAINING status, you receive an error.

That prevents any orphaned tasks from consuming resources. Deregistering a container instance removes the instance from a cluster, but it doesn't terminate the EC2 instance. If you are finished using the instance, be sure to terminate it in the Amazon EC2 console to stop billing. If you terminate a running container instance, Amazon ECS automatically deregisters the instance from your cluster (stopped container instances or instances with disconnected agents aren't automatically deregistered when terminated).

For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.

When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to ACTIVE status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

    /// Modifies the parameters of a service. For services using the rolling update (ECS) you can update the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, load balancers, service registries, enable ECS managed tags option, propagate tags option, task placement constraints and strategies, and task definition. When you update any of these parameters, Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the new configuration. For services using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, health check grace period, task placement constraints and strategies, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, task definition, or load balancer need to be updated, create a new CodeDeploy deployment. For more information, see [CreateDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html) in the CodeDeploy API Reference. For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, health check grace period, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags option, using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, create a new task set For more information, see [CreateTaskSet]. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy. If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, my_image:latest), you don't need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the forceNewDeployment option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start. You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy.
    ///
    /// * If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.
    ///
    /// * The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment. You can use it to define the deployment batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).
    ///
    ///
    /// When [UpdateService] stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout. After this, SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic.
    ///
    /// * Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition. For example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes.
    ///
    /// * By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner even though you can choose a different placement strategy.
    ///
    /// * Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.
    ///
    /// * Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.

Task-protection, by default, expires after 2 hours at which point Amazon ECS unsets the protectionEnabled property making the task eligible for termination by a subsequent scale-in event. You can specify a custom expiration period for task protection from 1 minute to up to 2,880 minutes (48 hours). To specify the custom expiration period, set the expiresInMinutes property. The expiresInMinutes property is always reset when you invoke this operation for a task that already has protectionEnabled set to true. You can keep extending the protection expiration period of a task by invoking this operation repeatedly. To learn more about Amazon ECS task protection, see [Task scale-in protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-scale-in-protection.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide . This operation is only supported for tasks belonging to an Amazon ECS service. Invoking this operation for a standalone task will result in an TASK_NOT_VALID failure. For more information, see [API failure reasons](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/api_failures_messages.html). If you prefer to set task protection from within the container, we recommend using the [Task scale-in protection endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-scale-in-protection-endpoint.html).
