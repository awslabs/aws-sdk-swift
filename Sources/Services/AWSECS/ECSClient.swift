    /// Performs the `CreateService` operation on the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceV20141113` service.

    /// Runs and maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the desiredCount, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the [UpdateService] action. Starting April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past 30-day period are considered current customers and will be able to continue using the service. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see [Service load balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer. There are two service scheduler strategies available:
    ///
    /// * REPLICA - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains your desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see [Service scheduler concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
    ///
    /// * DAEMON - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks. It also stops tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see [Service scheduler concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
    ///
    ///
    /// You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is initiated by changing properties. For example, the deployment might be initiated by the task definition or by your desired count of a service. This is done with an [UpdateService] operation. The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%. If a service uses the ECS deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of your desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if you set your service to have desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. If they're in the RUNNING state, tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy . If they're in the RUNNING state and reported as healthy by the load balancer, tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy . The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service uses the ECS deployment controller, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%. If a service uses either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state. This is while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used. This is the case even if they're currently visible when describing your service. When creating a service that uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the [CreateTaskSet] operation. For more information, see [Amazon ECS deployment types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement. For information about task placement and task placement strategies, see [Amazon ECS task placement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

    /// Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the service is actively maintaining tasks, you can't delete it, and you must update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information, see [UpdateService]. When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from ACTIVE to DRAINING, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the [ListServices] API operation. After all tasks have transitioned to either STOPPING or STOPPED status, the service status moves from DRAINING to INACTIVE. Services in the DRAINING or INACTIVE status can still be viewed with the [DescribeServices] API operation. However, in the future, INACTIVE services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and [DescribeServices] calls on those services return a ServiceNotFoundException error. If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing service in either ACTIVE or DRAINING status, you receive an error.

If you are finished using the instance, be sure to terminate it in the Amazon EC2 console to stop billing.

    /// Performs the `PutAccountSetting` operation on the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceV20141113` service.
    ///
    /// Modifies an account setting. Account settings are set on a per-Region basis. If you change the root user account setting, the default settings are reset for users and roles that do not have specified individual account settings. For more information, see [Account Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When you specify serviceLongArnFormat, taskLongArnFormat, or containerInstanceLongArnFormat, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging. When you specify awsvpcTrunking, the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature is changed. If awsvpcTrunking is turned on, any new container instances that support the feature are launched have the increased ENI limits available to them. For more information, see [Elastic Network Interface Trunking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When you specify containerInsights, the default setting indicating whether Amazon Web Services CloudWatch Container Insights is turned on for your clusters is changed. If containerInsights is turned on, any new clusters that are created will have Container Insights turned on unless you disable it during cluster creation. For more information, see [CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Amazon ECS is introducing tagging authorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for actions that create the resource, such as ecsCreateCluster. If tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the ecs:TagResource action. For more information, see [Grant permission to tag resources on creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/supported-iam-actions-tagging.html) in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide. When Amazon Web Services determines that a security or infrastructure update is needed for an Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate, the tasks need to be stopped and new tasks launched to replace them. Use fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod to configure the wait time to retire a Fargate task. For information about the Fargate tasks maintenance, see [Amazon Web Services Fargate task maintenance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-maintenance.html) in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide. The guardDutyActivate parameter is read-only in Amazon ECS and indicates whether Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring is enabled or disabled by your security administrator in your Amazon ECS account. Amazon GuardDuty controls this account setting on your behalf. For more information, see [Protecting Amazon ECS workloads with Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-guard-duty-integration.html).

For more information, see [IAM Roles for Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. You can specify a Docker networking mode for the containers in your task definition with the networkMode parameter. The available network modes correspond to those described in [Network settings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/network-settings) in the Docker run reference. If you specify the awsvpc network mode, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a [NetworkConfiguration] when you create a service or run a task with the task definition.

You can allow Amazon ECS to place tasks for you, or you can customize how Amazon ECS places tasks using placement constraints and placement strategies. For more information, see [Scheduling Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Alternatively, you can use [StartTask] to use your own scheduler or place tasks manually on specific container instances. Starting April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past 30-day period are considered current customers and will be able to continue using the service. The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model. This is because of the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command. To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:
    ///
    /// * Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait time.
    ///
    /// * Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting with a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait time.

The process for updating the agent differs depending on whether your container instance was launched with the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI or another operating system. The UpdateContainerAgent API isn't supported for container instances using the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 (arm64) AMI. To update the container agent, you can update the ecs-init package. This updates the agent. For more information, see [Updating the Amazon ECS container agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/agent-update-ecs-ami.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Agent updates with the UpdateContainerAgent API operation do not apply to Windows container instances. We recommend that you launch new container instances to update the agent version in your Windows clusters. The UpdateContainerAgent API requires an Amazon ECS-optimized AMI or Amazon Linux AMI with the ecs-init service installed and running. For help updating the Amazon ECS container agent on other operating systems, see [Manually updating the Amazon ECS container agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html#manually_update_agent) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

A container instance can't be changed to DRAINING until it has reached an ACTIVE status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received. When you set a container instance to DRAINING, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available.

Service tasks on the container instance that are in the RUNNING state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using [UpdateService].
    ///
    /// * If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during task replacement. For example, desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.
    ///
    /// * The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement. You can use this to define the replacement batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.
    ///
    ///
    /// Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a service aren't affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING tasks. You can verify this using [ListTasks]. When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to ACTIVE status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

    /// Performs the `UpdateService` operation on the `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceV20141113` service.

    /// Modifies the parameters of a service. For services using the rolling update (ECS) you can update the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, load balancers, service registries, enable ECS managed tags option, propagate tags option, task placement constraints and strategies, and task definition. When you update any of these parameters, Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the new configuration. For services using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, health check grace period, task placement constraints and strategies, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, task definition, or load balancer need to be updated, create a new CodeDeploy deployment. For more information, see [CreateDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html) in the CodeDeploy API Reference. For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, health check grace period, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags option, using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, create a new task set For more information, see [CreateTaskSet]. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy. If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, my_image:latest), you don't need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the forceNewDeployment option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start. You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy.
    ///
    /// * If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks.

Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.

For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).
    ///
    ///
    /// When [UpdateService] stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout. After this, SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic.
    ///
    /// * Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition. For example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes.
    ///
    /// * By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner even though you can choose a different placement strategy.
    ///
    /// * Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance.

Task-protection, by default, expires after 2 hours at which point Amazon ECS clears the protectionEnabled property making the task eligible for termination by a subsequent scale-in event. You can specify a custom expiration period for task protection from 1 minute to up to 2,880 minutes (48 hours). To specify the custom expiration period, set the expiresInMinutes property. The expiresInMinutes property is always reset when you invoke this operation for a task that already has protectionEnabled set to true. You can keep extending the protection expiration period of a task by invoking this operation repeatedly. To learn more about Amazon ECS task protection, see [Task scale-in protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-scale-in-protection.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide . This operation is only supported for tasks belonging to an Amazon ECS service. Invoking this operation for a standalone task will result in an TASK_NOT_VALID failure. For more information, see [API failure reasons](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/api_failures_messages.html). If you prefer to set task protection from within the container, we recommend using the [Task scale-in protection endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-scale-in-protection-endpoint.html).
