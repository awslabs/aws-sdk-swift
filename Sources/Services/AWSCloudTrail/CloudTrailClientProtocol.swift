/// CloudTrail This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail. CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service. As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see [Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). See the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html) for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services API call listed in the log files.

If you specify a key without a value, the tag will be created with the specified key and a value of null.

When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event. Example

You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or EventSelectors, but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors to a trail, any existing EventSelectors are overwritten.

For more considerations about importing trail events, see [Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-copy-trail-to-lake.html#cloudtrail-trail-copy-considerations).
