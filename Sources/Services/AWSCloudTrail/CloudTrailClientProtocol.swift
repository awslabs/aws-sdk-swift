/// CloudTrail This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail. CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service. As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see [Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). See the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html) for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services API call listed in the log files.

If you specify a key without a value, the tag will be created with the specified key and a value of null.

The table metadata stored in the Glue Data Catalog lets the Athena query engine know how to find, read, and process the data that you want to query.

If you want your trail to log Insights events, be sure the event selector enables logging of the Insights event types you want configured for your trail. For more information about logging Insights events, see [Logging Insights events for trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the CloudTrail User Guide. By default, trails created without specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event. Example
    ///
    /// * You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events.
    ///
    /// * The EC2 GetConsoleOutput and RunInstances API operations occur in your account.
    ///
    /// * CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.
    ///
    /// * The RunInstances is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.
    ///
    /// * The GetConsoleOutput is a read-only event that doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.
    ///
    ///
    /// The PutEventSelectors operation must be called from the Region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an InvalidHomeRegionException exception is thrown. You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail.

You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or EventSelectors, but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors to a trail, any existing EventSelectors are overwritten.

You also use PutInsightSelectors to turn off Insights event logging, by passing an empty list of Insights types. The valid Insights event types are ApiErrorRateInsight and ApiCallRateInsight. To enable Insights on an event data store, you must specify the ARNs (or ID suffix of the ARNs) for the source event data store (EventDataStore) and the destination event data store (InsightsDestination). The source event data store logs management events and enables Insights. The destination event data store logs Insights events based upon the management event activity of the source event data store. The source and destination event data stores must belong to the same Amazon Web Services account. To log Insights events for a trail, you must specify the name (TrailName) of the CloudTrail trail for which you want to change or add Insights selectors. To log CloudTrail Insights events on API call volume, the trail or event data store must log write management events. To log CloudTrail Insights events on API error rate, the trail or event data store must log read or write management events. You can call GetEventSelectors on a trail to check whether the trail logs management events.
