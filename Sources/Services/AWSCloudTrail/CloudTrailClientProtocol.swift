/// CloudTrail This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail. CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service. As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see [Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). See the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html) for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services API call listed in the log files.

Tag key names must be unique; you cannot have two keys with the same name but different values. If you specify a key without a value, the tag will be created with the specified key and a value of null.

    /// Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail. Use event selectors or advanced event selectors to specify management and data event settings for your trail. If you want your trail to log Insights events, be sure the event selector enables logging of the Insights event types you want configured for your trail. For more information about logging Insights events, see [Logging Insights events for trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the CloudTrail User Guide. By default, trails created without specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event. Example
    ///
    /// * You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events.
    ///
    /// * The EC2 GetConsoleOutput and RunInstances API operations occur in your account.
    ///
    /// * CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.
    ///
    /// * The RunInstances is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.
    ///
    /// * The GetConsoleOutput is a read-only event that doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.
    ///
    ///
    /// The PutEventSelectors operation must be called from the Region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an InvalidHomeRegionException exception is thrown. You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more information, see [Logging management events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html), [Logging data events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html), and [Quotas in CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html) in the CloudTrail User Guide. You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or EventSelectors, but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors to a trail, any existing EventSelectors are overwritten.

By default, CloudTrail only imports events contained in the S3 bucket's CloudTrail prefix and the prefixes inside the CloudTrail prefix, and does not check prefixes for other Amazon Web Services services. If you want to import CloudTrail events contained in another prefix, you must include the prefix in the S3LocationUri. For more considerations about importing trail events, see [Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-copy-trail-to-lake.html#cloudtrail-trail-copy-considerations). When you start a new import, the Destinations and ImportSource parameters are required. Before starting a new import, disable any access control lists (ACLs) attached to the source S3 bucket. For more information about disabling ACLs, see [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html). When you retry an import, the ImportID parameter is required. If the destination event data store is for an organization, you must use the management account to import trail events. You cannot use the delegated administrator account for the organization.
