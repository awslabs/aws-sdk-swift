/// With Amazon CloudWatch RUM, you can perform real-user monitoring to collect client-side data about your web application performance from actual user sessions in real time. The data collected includes page load times, client-side errors, and user behavior. When you view this data, you can see it all aggregated together and also see breakdowns by the browsers and devices that your customers use. You can use the collected data to quickly identify and debug client-side performance issues. CloudWatch RUM helps you visualize anomalies in your application performance and find relevant debugging data such as error messages, stack traces, and user sessions. You can also use RUM to understand the range of end-user impact including the number of users, geolocations, and browsers used.
public protocol RUMClientProtocol {
    /// Specifies the extended metrics and custom metrics that you want a CloudWatch RUM app monitor to send to a destination. Valid destinations include CloudWatch and Evidently. By default, RUM app monitors send some metrics to CloudWatch. These default metrics are listed in [CloudWatch metrics that you can collect with CloudWatch RUM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-metrics.html). In addition to these default metrics, you can choose to send extended metrics or custom metrics or both.
    ///
    /// * Extended metrics enable you to send metrics with additional dimensions not included in the default metrics. You can also send extended metrics to Evidently as well as CloudWatch. The valid dimension names for the additional dimensions for extended metrics are BrowserName, CountryCode, DeviceType, FileType, OSName, and PageId. For more information, see [ Extended metrics that you can send to CloudWatch and CloudWatch Evidently](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-vended-metrics.html).
    ///
    /// * Custom metrics are metrics that you define. You can send custom metrics to CloudWatch or to CloudWatch Evidently or to both. With custom metrics, you can use any metric name and namespace, and to derive the metrics you can use any custom events, built-in events, custom attributes, or default attributes. You can't send custom metrics to the AWS/RUM namespace. You must send custom metrics to a custom namespace that you define. The namespace that you use can't start with AWS/. CloudWatch RUM prepends RUM/CustomMetrics/ to the custom namespace that you define, so the final namespace for your metrics in CloudWatch is RUM/CustomMetrics/your-custom-namespace .

Each combination of additional dimension name and dimension value counts as a custom metric. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/). You must have already created a destination for the metrics before you send them. For more information, see [PutRumMetricsDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchrum/latest/APIReference/API_PutRumMetricsDestination.html).
