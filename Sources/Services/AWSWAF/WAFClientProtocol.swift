You then use [UpdateByteMatchSet] to identify the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as the values of the User-Agent header or the query string. For example, you can create a ByteMatchSet that matches any requests with User-Agent headers that contain the string BadBot. You can then configure AWS WAF to reject those requests. To create and configure a ByteMatchSet, perform the following steps:

    /// This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide. For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. Creates a [RateBasedRule]. The RateBasedRule contains a RateLimit, which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The RateBasedRule also contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the RateLimit. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request not only must exceed the RateLimit, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule:
    ///
    /// * An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32
    ///
    /// * A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header
    ///
    ///
    /// Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a RateBasedRule:
    ///
    /// * A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI
    ///
    /// * A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH
    ///
    /// * A TargetString of login
    ///
    ///
    /// Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. By adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site. To create and configure a RateBasedRule, perform the following steps:
    ///
    /// * Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the rule. For more information, see [CreateByteMatchSet], [CreateIPSet], and [CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet].

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. When you want to create, update, or delete AWS WAF objects, get a change token and include the change token in the create, update, or delete request. Change tokens ensure that your application doesn't submit conflicting requests to AWS WAF. Each create, update, or delete request must use a unique change token. If your application submits a GetChangeToken request and then submits a second GetChangeToken request before submitting a create, update, or delete request, the second GetChangeToken request returns the same value as the first GetChangeToken request. When you use a change token in a create, update, or delete request, the status of the change token changes to PENDING, which indicates that AWS WAF is propagating the change to all AWS WAF servers.

For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. Inserts or deletes [Predicate] objects in a rule and updates the RateLimit in the rule. Each Predicate object identifies a predicate, such as a [ByteMatchSet] or an [IPSet], that specifies the web requests that you want to block or count. The RateLimit specifies the number of requests every five minutes that triggers the rule. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request must match all the predicates and exceed the RateLimit to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule:
    ///
    /// * An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32
    ///
    /// * A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header

For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. Inserts or deletes [ActivatedRule] objects in a WebACL. Each Rule identifies web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. When you update a WebACL, you specify the following values:
    ///
    /// * A default action for the WebACL, either ALLOW or BLOCK. AWS WAF performs the default action if a request doesn't match the criteria in any of the Rules in a WebACL.
    ///
    /// * The Rules that you want to add or delete. If you want to replace one Rule with another, you delete the existing Rule and add the new one.
    ///
    /// * For each Rule, whether you want AWS WAF to allow requests, block requests, or count requests that match the conditions in the Rule.
    ///
    /// * The order in which you want AWS WAF to evaluate the Rules in a WebACL. If you add more than one Rule to a WebACL, AWS WAF evaluates each request against the Rules in order based on the value of Priority. (The Rule that has the lowest value for Priority is evaluated first.) When a web request matches all the predicates (such as ByteMatchSets and IPSets) in a Rule, AWS WAF immediately takes the corresponding action, allow or block, and doesn't evaluate the request against the remaining Rules in the WebACL, if any.
    ///
    ///
    /// To create and configure a WebACL, perform the following steps:
    ///
    /// * Create and update the predicates that you want to include in Rules. For more information, see [CreateByteMatchSet], [UpdateByteMatchSet], [CreateIPSet], [UpdateIPSet], [CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet], and [UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet].
    ///
    /// * Create and update the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL. For more information, see [CreateRule] and [UpdateRule].
    ///
    /// * Create a WebACL. See [CreateWebACL].

    ///
    /// * Submit an UpdateWebACL request to specify the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL, to specify the default action, and to associate the WebACL with a CloudFront distribution. The ActivatedRule can be a rule group. If you specify a rule group as your ActivatedRule , you can exclude specific rules from that rule group. If you already have a rule group associated with a web ACL and want to submit an UpdateWebACL request to exclude certain rules from that rule group, you must first remove the rule group from the web ACL, the re-insert it again, specifying the excluded rules. For details, see [ActivatedRule$ExcludedRules] .
    ///
    ///
    /// Be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the rule type when first creating the rule, the [UpdateWebACL] request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule (the default rule type) with the specified ID, which does not exist.
