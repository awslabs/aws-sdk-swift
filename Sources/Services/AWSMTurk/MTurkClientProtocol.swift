This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the properties of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of assignments. When you pass these values to CreateHIT, a new HIT is created for you, with a new HITTypeID. The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time. An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using the CreateHITType operation and then call the CreateHITWithHITType operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs. CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the Question parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a HitLayoutId and associated HitLayoutParameters. If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee. For more information, see [Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing](https://requester.mturk.com/pricing).

You must include a message that explains the reason for the bonus payment, as the Worker may not be expecting the payment. Amazon Mechanical Turk collects a fee for bonus payments, similar to the HIT listing fee. This operation fails if your account does not have enough funds to pay for both the bonus and the fees.

    /// The UpdateQualificationType operation modifies the attributes of an existing Qualification type, which is represented by a QualificationType data structure. Only the owner of a Qualification type can modify its attributes. Most attributes of a Qualification type can be changed after the type has been created. However, the Name and Keywords fields cannot be modified. The RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be modified or added to change the delay or to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot be used to disable retries. You can use this operation to update the test for a Qualification type. The test is updated based on the values specified for the Test, TestDurationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three parameters specify the updated test. If you are updating the test for a type, you must specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds parameters. The AnswerKey parameter is optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does not have an answer key. If you omit the Test parameter, the test for the Qualification type is unchanged. There is no way to remove a test from a Qualification type that has one. If the type already has a test, you cannot update it to be AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test and one is provided by an update, the type will henceforth have a test. If you want to update the test duration or answer key for an existing test without changing the questions, you must specify a Test parameter with the original questions, along with the updated values. If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will not have an answer key. Requests for such Qualifications must be granted manually. You can also update the AutoGranted and AutoGrantedValue attributes of the Qualification type.
