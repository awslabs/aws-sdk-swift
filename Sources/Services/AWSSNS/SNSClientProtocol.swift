/// Amazon Simple Notification Service Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see the [Amazon SNS product page](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/). For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the [Amazon SNS Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/). For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see [Identity and access management in Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-authentication-and-access-control.html) in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide. We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

The result of publishing each message is reported individually in the response.

The maximum allowed individual message size and the maximum total payload size (the sum of the individual lengths of all of the batched messages) are both 256 KB (262,144 bytes). Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this: &AttributeName.1=first &AttributeName.2=second If you send a batch message to a topic, Amazon SNS publishes the batch message to each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of the batch message depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed endpoint.
