/// Amazon Transcribe streaming offers three main types of real-time transcription: Standard, Medical, and Call Analytics.
///
/// * Standard transcriptions are the most common option. Refer to for details.
///
/// * Medical transcriptions are tailored to medical professionals and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient dialogue in real time, so doctors can focus on their patient instead of taking notes. Refer to for details.
///
/// * Call Analytics transcriptions are designed for use with call center audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer service calls, use this option. Refer to for details.
