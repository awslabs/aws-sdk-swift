/// Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects event sources to targets. Pipes reduces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing event driven architectures. This helps ensures consistency across your companyâ€™s applications. With Pipes, the target can be any available EventBridge target. To set up a pipe, you select the event source, add optional event filtering, define optional enrichment, and select the target for the event data.

    /// Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified pipe. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can use the TagResource action with a pipe that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the pipe. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the pipe, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a pipe.

    /// Update an existing pipe. When you call UpdatePipe, only the fields that are included in the request are changed, the rest are unchanged. The exception to this is if you modify any Amazon Web Services-service specific fields in the SourceParameters, EnrichmentParameters, or TargetParameters objects. The fields in these objects are updated atomically as one and override existing values. This is by design and means that if you don't specify an optional field in one of these Parameters objects, that field will be set to its system-default value after the update.
