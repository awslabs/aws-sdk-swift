/// Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects event sources to targets. Pipes reduces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing event driven architectures. This helps ensures consistency across your companyâ€™s applications. With Pipes, the target can be any available EventBridge target. To set up a pipe, you select the event source, add optional event filtering, define optional enrichment, and select the target for the event data.

The exception to this is if you modify any Amazon Web Services-service specific fields in the SourceParameters, EnrichmentParameters, or TargetParameters objects. For example, DynamoDBStreamParameters or EventBridgeEventBusParameters. EventBridge updates the fields in these objects atomically as one and overrides existing values. This is by design, and means that if you don't specify an optional field in one of these Parameters objects, EventBridge sets that field to its system-default value during the update.
