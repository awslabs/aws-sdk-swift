/// App Runner App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source code to a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to provision and configure Amazon Web Services resources. App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and security. For more information about App Runner, see the [App Runner Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/). For release information, see the [App Runner Release Notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/). To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). Endpoints For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see [App Runner endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
public protocol AppRunnerClientProtocol {
    /// Associate your own domain name with the App Runner subdomain URL of your App Runner service. After you call AssociateCustomDomain and receive a successful response, use the information in the [CustomDomain] record that's returned to add CNAME records to your Domain Name System (DNS). For each mapped domain name, add a mapping to the target App Runner subdomain and one or more certificate validation records. App Runner then performs DNS validation to verify that you own or control the domain name that you associated. App Runner tracks domain validity in a certificate stored in [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide).
    func associateCustomDomain(input: AssociateCustomDomainInput) async throws -> AssociateCustomDomainOutputResponse
    /// Create an App Runner automatic scaling configuration resource. App Runner requires this resource when you create or update App Runner services and you require non-default auto scaling settings. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services. Create multiple revisions of a configuration by calling this action multiple times using the same AutoScalingConfigurationName. The call returns incremental AutoScalingConfigurationRevision values. When you create a service and configure an auto scaling configuration resource, the service uses the latest active revision of the auto scaling configuration by default. You can optionally configure the service to use a specific revision. Configure a higher MinSize to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost. Configure a lower MaxSize to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.

    /// Create an App Runner connection resource. App Runner requires a connection resource when you create App Runner services that access private repositories from certain third-party providers. You can share a connection across multiple services. A connection resource is needed to access GitHub repositories. GitHub requires a user interface approval process through the App Runner console before you can use the connection.

    /// Create an App Runner observability configuration resource. App Runner requires this resource when you create or update App Runner services and you want to enable non-default observability features. You can share an observability configuration across multiple services. Create multiple revisions of a configuration by calling this action multiple times using the same ObservabilityConfigurationName. The call returns incremental ObservabilityConfigurationRevision values. When you create a service and configure an observability configuration resource, the service uses the latest active revision of the observability configuration by default. You can optionally configure the service to use a specific revision. The observability configuration resource is designed to configure multiple features (currently one feature, tracing). This action takes optional parameters that describe the configuration of these features (currently one parameter, TraceConfiguration). If you don't specify a feature parameter, App Runner doesn't enable the feature.
