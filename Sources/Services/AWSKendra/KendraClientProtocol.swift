    /// Creates an access configuration for your documents. This includes user and group access information for your documents. This is useful for user context filtering, where search results are filtered based on the user or their group access to documents. You can use this to re-configure your existing document level access control without indexing all of your documents again. For example, your index contains top-secret company documents that only certain employees or users should access. One of these users leaves the company or switches to a team that should be blocked from accessing top-secret documents. The user still has access to top-secret documents because the user had access when your documents were previously indexed. You can create a specific access control configuration for the user with deny access. You can later update the access control configuration to allow access if the user returns to the company and re-joins the 'top-secret' team. You can re-configure access control for your documents as circumstances change. To apply your access control configuration to certain documents, you call the [BatchPutDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_BatchPutDocument.html) API with the AccessControlConfigurationId included in the [Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_Document.html) object. If you use an S3 bucket as a data source, you update the .metadata.json with the AccessControlConfigurationId and synchronize your data source. Amazon Kendra currently only supports access control configuration for S3 data sources and documents indexed using the BatchPutDocument API.

    /// Retrieves relevant passages or text excerpts given an input query. This API is similar to the [Query](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html) API. However, by default, the Query API only returns excerpt passages of up to 100 token words. With the Retrieve API, you can retrieve longer passages of up to 200 token words and up to 100 semantically relevant passages. This doesn't include question-answer or FAQ type responses from your index. The passages are text excerpts that can be semantically extracted from multiple documents and multiple parts of the same document. If in extreme cases your documents produce zero passages using the Retrieve API, you can alternatively use the Query API and its types of responses. You can also do the following:
    ///
    /// * Override boosting at the index level
    ///
    /// * Filter based on document fields or attributes
    ///
    /// * Filter based on the user or their group access to documents
    ///
    /// * View the confidence score bucket for a retrieved passage result. The confidence bucket provides a relative ranking that indicates how confident Amazon Kendra is that the response is relevant to the query. Confidence score buckets are currently available only for English.
    ///
    ///
    /// You can also include certain fields in the response that might provide useful additional information. The Retrieve API shares the number of [query capacity units](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/APIReference/API_CapacityUnitsConfiguration.html) that you set for your index. For more information on what's included in a single capacity unit and the default base capacity for an index, see [Adjusting capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/adjusting-capacity.html).

This is useful for user context filtering, where search results are filtered based on the user or their group access to documents. You can update an access control configuration you created without indexing all of your documents again. For example, your index contains top-secret company documents that only certain employees or users should access. You created an 'allow' access control configuration for one user who recently joined the 'top-secret' team, switching from a team with 'deny' access to top-secret documents. However, the user suddenly returns to their previous team and should no longer have access to top secret documents. You can update the access control configuration to re-configure access control for your documents as circumstances change. You call the [BatchPutDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_BatchPutDocument.html) API to apply the updated access control configuration, with the AccessControlConfigurationId included in the [Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_Document.html) object. If you use an S3 bucket as a data source, you synchronize your data source to apply the AccessControlConfigurationId in the .metadata.json file. Amazon Kendra currently only supports access control configuration for S3 data sources and documents indexed using the BatchPutDocument API.
