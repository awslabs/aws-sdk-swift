For example, your index contains top-secret company documents that only certain employees or users should access. One of these users leaves the company or switches to a team that should be blocked from accessing top-secret documents. The user still has access to top-secret documents because the user had access when your documents were previously indexed.

You can later update the access control configuration to allow access if the user returns to the company and re-joins the 'top-secret' team. You can re-configure access control for your documents as circumstances change. To apply your access control configuration to certain documents, you call the [BatchPutDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_BatchPutDocument.html) API with the AccessControlConfigurationId included in the [Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_Document.html) object.
