/// Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager provides a service to enable you to store, manage, and retrieve, secrets. This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the [Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html). API Version This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17. For a list of endpoints, see [Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/asm_access.html#endpoints). Support and Feedback for Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to [awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com](mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com), or post your feedback and questions in the [Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Discussion Forum](http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296). For more information about the Amazon Web Services Discussion Forums, see [Forums Help](http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa). Logging API Requests Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see [Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail) in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the [Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html).

    /// Turns off automatic rotation, and if a rotation is currently in progress, cancels the rotation. If you cancel a rotation in progress, it can leave the VersionStage labels in an unexpected state. You might need to remove the staging label AWSPENDING from the partially created version. You also need to determine whether to roll back to the previous version of the secret by moving the staging label AWSCURRENT to the version that has AWSPENDING. To determine which version has a specific staging label, call [ListSecretVersionIds]. Then use [UpdateSecretVersionStage] to change staging labels. For more information, see [How rotation works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_how.html). To turn on automatic rotation again, call [RotateSecret]. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see [Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html). Required permissions: secretsmanager:CancelRotateSecret.

    func cancelRotateSecret(input: CancelRotateSecretInput) async throws -> CancelRotateSecretOutputResponse
    /// Creates a new secret. A secret can be a password, a set of credentials such as a user name and password, an OAuth token, or other secret information that you store in an encrypted form in Secrets Manager. The secret also includes the connection information to access a database or other service, which Secrets Manager doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret. For secrets that use managed rotation, you need to create the secret through the managing service. For more information, see [Secrets Manager secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/service-linked-secrets.html). For information about creating a secret in the console, see [Create a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html). To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the SecretString parameter or the SecretBinary parameter, but not both. If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to it. For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the JSON you store in the SecretString matches the [JSON structure of a database secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_secret_json_structure.html). If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use aws/secretsmanager. Creating aws/secretsmanager can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then you can't use aws/secretsmanager to encrypt the secret, and you must create and use a customer managed KMS key. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except SecretBinary or SecretString because it might be logged. For more information, see [Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html). Required permissions: secretsmanager:CreateSecret. If you include tags in the secret, you also need secretsmanager:TagResource. For more information, see [ IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#reference_iam-permissions_actions) and [Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html). To encrypt the secret with a KMS key other than aws/secretsmanager, you need kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permission to the key.

At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently. You can't delete a primary secret that is replicated to other Regions. You must first delete the replicas using [RemoveRegionsFromReplication], and then delete the primary secret. When you delete a replica, it is deleted immediately. You can't directly delete a version of a secret. Instead, you remove all staging labels from the version using [UpdateSecretVersionStage]. This marks the version as deprecated, and then Secrets Manager can automatically delete the version in the background. To determine whether an application still uses a secret, you can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to alert you to any attempts to access a secret during the recovery window. For more information, see [ Monitor secrets scheduled for deletion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets.html). Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the permanent delete to occur. At any time before recovery window ends, you can use [RestoreSecret] to remove the DeletionDate and cancel the deletion of the secret. When a secret is scheduled for deletion, you cannot retrieve the secret value. You must first cancel the deletion with [RestoreSecret] and then you can retrieve the secret.

If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged.
