/// * If you are working with an AWS SDK, use the QLDB driver. The driver provides a high-level abstraction layer above this QLDB Session data plane and manages SendCommand API calls for you. For information and a list of supported programming languages, see [Getting started with the driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-driver.html) in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide.
