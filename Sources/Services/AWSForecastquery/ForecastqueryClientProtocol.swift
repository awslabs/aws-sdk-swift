    /// Retrieves a forecast for a single item, filtered by the supplied criteria. The criteria is a key-value pair. The key is either item_id (or the equivalent non-timestamp, non-target field) from the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset, or one of the forecast dimensions specified as part of the FeaturizationConfig object. By default, QueryForecast returns the complete date range for the filtered forecast. You can request a specific date range. To get the full forecast, use the [CreateForecastExportJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_CreateForecastExportJob.html) operation. The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same timezone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.
