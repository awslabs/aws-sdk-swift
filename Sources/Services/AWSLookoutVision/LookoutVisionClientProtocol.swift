/// This is the Amazon Lookout for Vision API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors. Amazon Lookout for Vision enables you to find visual defects in industrial products, accurately and at scale. It uses computer vision to identify missing components in an industrial product, damage to vehicles or structures, irregularities in production lines, and even minuscule defects in silicon wafers — or any other physical item where quality is important such as a missing capacitor on printed circuit boards.

Any existing annotations that are not in the new JSON line are removed from the dataset. For more information, see Defining JSON lines for anomaly classification in the Amazon Lookout for Vision Developer Guide. The images you reference in the source-ref field of a JSON line, must be in the same S3 bucket as the existing images in the dataset. Updating a dataset might take a while to complete. To check the current status, call [DescribeDataset] and check the Status field in the response. This operation requires permissions to perform the lookoutvision:UpdateDatasetEntries operation.
