You should then pass the data destination into the [CreateCampaign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCampaign.html) API operation. You must delete any existing campaigns that include an empty data destination before you register your account again. For more information, see the [DeleteCampaign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCampaign.html) API operation. If you want to delete the Timestream inline policy from the service-linked role, such as to mitigate an overly permissive policy, you must first delete any existing campaigns. Then delete the service-linked role and register your account again to enable CloudWatch metrics.
