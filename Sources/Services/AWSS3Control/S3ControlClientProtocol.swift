To delete an S3 bucket policy, see [DeleteBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketPolicy.html) in the Amazon S3 API Reference. This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the s3-outposts:DeleteBucketPolicy permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this action. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in Amazon S3 User Guide.

To put a policy on an S3 bucket, see [PutBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketPolicy.html) in the Amazon S3 API Reference. Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Outposts bucket. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the Outposts bucket, the calling identity must have the PutBucketPolicy permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this action. If you don't have PutBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403 Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error. As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action. For more information about bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html). All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketPolicy.html#API_control_PutBucketPolicy_Examples) section.

To put tags on an S3 bucket, see [PutBucketTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketTagging.html) in the Amazon S3 API Reference. Sets the tags for an S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see [Cost allocation and tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html). Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value. For more information, see [ Using cost allocation in Amazon S3 bucket tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html). To use this action, you must have permissions to perform the s3-outposts:PutBucketTagging action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [ Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing access permissions to your Amazon S3 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

To set the versioning state for an S3 bucket, see [PutBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html) in the Amazon S3 API Reference. Sets the versioning state for an S3 on Outposts bucket. With versioning, you can save multiple distinct copies of your data and recover from unintended user actions and application failures. You can set the versioning state to one of the following:
    ///
    /// * Enabled - Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.
    ///
    /// * Suspended - Suspends versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

In that case, a [ GetBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketVersioning.html) request does not return a versioning state value. When you enable S3 Versioning, for each object in your bucket, you have a current version and zero or more noncurrent versions. You can configure your bucket S3 Lifecycle rules to expire noncurrent versions after a specified time period. For more information, see [ Creating and managing a lifecycle configuration for your S3 on Outposts bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsLifecycleManaging.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket.
