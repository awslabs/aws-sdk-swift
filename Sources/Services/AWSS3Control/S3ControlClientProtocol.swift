To delete an S3 bucket policy, see [DeleteBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketPolicy.html) in the Amazon S3 API Reference. This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the s3-outposts:DeleteBucketPolicy permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this action. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in Amazon S3 User Guide. If you don't have DeleteBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403 Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error. As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

It can take a while to propagate PUT or DELETE requests for a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication configuration that's returned by a GET request soon after a PUT or DELETE request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost.

To create an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see [PutBucketReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketReplication.html) in the Amazon S3 API Reference. Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see [Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. It can take a while to propagate PUT or DELETE requests for a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication configuration that's returned by a GET request soon after a PUT or DELETE request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant. Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the following information:
    ///
    /// * The name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want S3 on Outposts to replicate objects
    ///
    /// * The Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that S3 on Outposts can assume to replicate objects on your behalf
    ///
    /// * Other relevant information, such as replication rules
    ///
    ///
    /// A replication configuration must include at least one rule and can contain a maximum of 100. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source Outposts bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset. To specify a subset of the objects in the source Outposts bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: DeleteMarkerReplication, Status, and Priority. Using PutBucketReplication on Outposts requires that both the source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see [Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsManagingVersioning.html). For information about S3 on Outposts replication failure reasons, see [Replication failure reasons](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/outposts-replication-eventbridge.html#outposts-replication-failure-codes) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects Outposts buckets are encrypted at all times. All the objects in the source Outposts bucket are encrypted and can be replicated. Also, all the replicas in the destination Outposts bucket are encrypted with the same encryption key as the objects in the source Outposts bucket. Permissions To create a PutBucketReplication request, you must have s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration permissions for the bucket. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see [Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsIAM.html) and [Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsBucketPolicy.html). To perform this operation, the user or role must also have the iam:CreateRole and iam:PassRole permissions. For more information, see [Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an Amazon Web Services service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html). All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketReplication.html#API_control_PutBucketReplication_Examples) section.

Sets the tags for an S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see [Cost allocation and tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html). Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value. For more information, see [ Using cost allocation in Amazon S3 bucket tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html).

Sets the versioning state for an S3 on Outposts bucket. With S3 Versioning, you can save multiple distinct copies of your objects and recover from unintended user actions and application failures. You can set the versioning state to one of the following:
    ///
    /// * Enabled - Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.
    ///
    /// * Suspended - Suspends versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.
    ///
    ///
    /// If you've never set versioning on your bucket, it has no versioning state. In that case, a [ GetBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketVersioning.html) request does not return a versioning state value. When you enable S3 Versioning, for each object in your bucket, you have a current version and zero or more noncurrent versions. You can configure your bucket S3 Lifecycle rules to expire noncurrent versions after a specified time period. For more information, see [ Creating and managing a lifecycle configuration for your S3 on Outposts bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsLifecycleManaging.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you have an object expiration lifecycle configuration in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle configuration will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. For more information, see [Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketVersioning.html#API_control_PutBucketVersioning_Examples) section.
