/// Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of your Amazon Web Services environment and resources. It also provides you with the readiness status of your environment based on controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects security data from Amazon Web Services accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see the [ Security Hub User Guide ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html). When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, run the same command for each Region in which you want to apply the change. For example, if your Region is set to us-west-2, when you use CreateMembers to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of the member account with the administrator account is created only in the us-west-2 Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region that the invitation was sent from. The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API operations.

This operation is only used to invite accounts that do not belong to an organization. Organization accounts do not receive invitations. Before you can use this action to invite a member, you must first use the CreateMembers action to create the member account in Security Hub. When the account owner enables Security Hub and accepts the invitation to become a member account, the administrator account can view the findings generated from the member account.
