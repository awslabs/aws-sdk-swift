Users within a domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other. EFS storage When a domain is created, an EFS volume is created for use by all of the users within the domain. Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS volume for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files. SageMaker uses the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) to encrypt the EFS volume attached to the domain with an Amazon Web Services managed key by default. For more control, you can specify a customer managed key. For more information, see [Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/encryption-at-rest.html). VPC configuration All SageMaker Studio traffic between the domain and the EFS volume is through the specified VPC and subnets. For other Studio traffic, you can specify the AppNetworkAccessType parameter. AppNetworkAccessType corresponds to the network access type that you choose when you onboard to Studio. The following options are available:
    ///

Use this API to deploy models using SageMaker hosting services. You must not delete an EndpointConfig that is in use by an endpoint that is live or while the UpdateEndpoint or CreateEndpoint operations are being performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new EndpointConfig. The endpoint name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in your Amazon Web Services account. When it receives the request, SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them. When you call [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html), a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting [Eventually Consistent Reads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html), the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB, this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call [DescribeEndpointConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpointConfig.html) before calling [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html) to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read. When SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to Creating. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to InService. SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the [DescribeEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpoint.html) API. If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, SageMaker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. Amazon Web Services STS is activated in your Amazon Web Services account by default. If you previously deactivated Amazon Web Services STS for a region, you need to reactivate Amazon Web Services STS for that region. For more information, see [Activating and Deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide.

    /// You can also use automated data labeling to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses active learning to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see [Using Automated Data Labeling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-automated-labeling.html). The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create a manifest file that describes the location of each object. For more information, see [Using Input and Output Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-data.html). The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or as training data for your machine learning models. You can use this operation to create a static labeling job or a streaming labeling job. A static labeling job stops if all data objects in the input manifest file identified in ManifestS3Uri have been labeled. A streaming labeling job runs perpetually until it is manually stopped, or remains idle for 10 days. You can send new data objects to an active (InProgress) streaming labeling job in real time. To learn how to create a static labeling job, see [Create a Labeling Job (API) ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-create-labeling-job-api.html) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.

For the primary container, you specify the Docker image that contains inference code, artifacts (from prior training), and a custom environment map that the inference code uses when you deploy the model for predictions. Use this API to create a model if you want to use SageMaker hosting services or run a batch transform job. To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the CreateEndpointConfig API, and then create an endpoint with the CreateEndpoint API. SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment. For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to SageMaker hosting services, see [Create a Model (Amazon Web Services SDK for Python (Boto 3)).](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-deployment.html#realtime-endpoints-deployment-create-model) To run a batch transform using your model, you start a job with the CreateTransformJob API. SageMaker uses your model and your dataset to get inferences which are then saved to a specified S3 location. In the request, you also provide an IAM role that SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances or for batch transform jobs. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs. For example, if the inference code access any other Amazon Web Services resources, you grant necessary permissions via this role.

    /// Use this operation to update your workforce. You can use this operation to require that workers use specific IP addresses to work on tasks and to update your OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP) workforce configuration. The worker portal is now supported in VPC and public internet. Use SourceIpConfig to restrict worker access to tasks to a specific range of IP addresses. You specify allowed IP addresses by creating a list of up to ten [CIDRs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html). By default, a workforce isn't restricted to specific IP addresses. If you specify a range of IP addresses, workers who attempt to access tasks using any IP address outside the specified range are denied and get a Not Found error message on the worker portal. To restrict access to all the workers in public internet, add the SourceIpConfig CIDR value as "10.0.0.0/16". Amazon SageMaker does not support Source Ip restriction for worker portals in VPC. Use OidcConfig to update the configuration of a workforce created using your own OIDC IdP. You can only update your OIDC IdP configuration when there are no work teams associated with your workforce. You can delete work teams using the [DeleteWorkteam](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteWorkteam.html) operation. After restricting access to a range of IP addresses or updating your OIDC IdP configuration with this operation, you can view details about your update workforce using the [DescribeWorkforce](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeWorkforce.html) operation. This operation only applies to private workforces.
