/// Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing to setup or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.

    /// Creates an Amazon EKS control plane. The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, such as etcd and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by Amazon Web Services, and the Kubernetes API is exposed by the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances. The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec, logs, and proxy data flows). Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster. You can use the endpointPublicAccess and endpointPrivateAccess parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and private access is disabled. For more information, see [Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide . You can use the logging parameter to enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide . CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see [CloudWatch Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/). In most cases, it takes several minutes to create a cluster. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your cluster. For more information, see [Managing Cluster Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-auth.html) and [Launching Amazon EKS nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide.

The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profile’s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate. When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes [Role Based Access Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) (RBAC) for authorization so that the kubelet that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see [Pod Execution Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-execution-role.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide. Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated profile has finished creating. If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the DELETING status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can create any other profiles in that cluster. For more information, see [Fargate profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide.

Amazon EKS Pod Identity associations provide the ability to manage credentials for your applications, similar to the way that Amazon EC2 instance profiles provide credentials to Amazon EC2 instances. If a pod uses a service account that has an association, Amazon EKS sets environment variables in the containers of the pod. The environment variables configure the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including the Command Line Interface, to use the EKS Pod Identity credentials. Pod Identity is a simpler method than IAM roles for service accounts, as this method doesn't use OIDC identity providers. Additionally, you can configure a role for Pod Identity once, and reuse it across clusters.

You can't change which VPC the subnets are from, the subnets must be in the same VPC as the subnets that the cluster was created with. For more information about the VPC requirements, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide . Cluster updates are asynchronous, and they should finish within a few minutes. During an update, the cluster status moves to UPDATING (this status transition is eventually consistent). When the update is complete (either Failed or Successful), the cluster status moves to Active.

Amazon EKS attempts to drain the nodes gracefully and will fail if it is unable to do so. You can force the update if Amazon EKS is unable to drain the nodes as a result of a Pod disruption budget issue.
