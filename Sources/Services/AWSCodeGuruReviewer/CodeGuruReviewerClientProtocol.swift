/// This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API operations. CodeGuru Reviewer is a service that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect potential defects that are difficult for developers to find and recommends fixes in your Java and Python code. By proactively detecting and providing recommendations for addressing code defects and implementing best practices, CodeGuru Reviewer improves the overall quality and maintainability of your code base during the code review stage. For more information about CodeGuru Reviewer, see the [Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html). To improve the security of your CodeGuru Reviewer API calls, you can establish a private connection between your VPC and CodeGuru Reviewer by creating an interface VPC endpoint. For more information, see [CodeGuru Reviewer and interface VPC endpoints (Amazon Web Services PrivateLink)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/vpc-interface-endpoints.html) in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide.
public protocol CodeGuruReviewerClientProtocol {
    /// Use to associate an Amazon Web Services CodeCommit repository or a repository managed by Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. When you associate a repository, CodeGuru Reviewer reviews source code changes in the repository's pull requests and provides automatic recommendations. You can view recommendations using the CodeGuru Reviewer console. For more information, see [Recommendations in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/recommendations.html) in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide. If you associate a CodeCommit or S3 repository, it must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region and Amazon Web Services account where its CodeGuru Reviewer code reviews are configured. Bitbucket and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories are managed by Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections to connect to CodeGuru Reviewer. For more information, see [Associate a repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/getting-started-associate-repository.html) in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide. You cannot use the CodeGuru Reviewer SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI to associate a GitHub repository with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. To associate a GitHub repository, use the console. For more information, see [Getting started with CodeGuru Reviewer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/getting-started-with-guru.html) in the CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide.
