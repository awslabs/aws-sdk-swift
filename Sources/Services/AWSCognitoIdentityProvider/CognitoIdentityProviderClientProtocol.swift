/// With the Amazon Cognito user pools API, you can set up user pools and app clients, and authenticate users. To authenticate users from third-party identity providers (IdPs) in this API, you can [link IdP users to native user profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation-consolidate-users.html). Learn more about the authentication and authorization of federated users in the [Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html). This API reference provides detailed information about API operations and object types in Amazon Cognito. At the bottom of the page for each API operation and object, under See Also, you can learn how to use it in an Amazon Web Services SDK in the language of your choice. Along with resource management operations, the Amazon Cognito user pools API includes classes of operations and authorization models for client-side and server-side user operations. For more information, see [Using the Amazon Cognito native and OIDC APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html) in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. You can also start reading about the CognitoIdentityProvider client in the following SDK guides.
