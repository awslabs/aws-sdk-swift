    /// Creates a new user in the specified user pool. If MessageAction isn't set, the default is to send a welcome message via email or phone (SMS). This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in. If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [sandbox mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [ SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-sms-userpool-settings.html) in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. This message is based on a template that you configured in your call to create or update a user pool. This template includes your custom sign-up instructions and placeholders for user name and temporary password. Alternatively, you can call AdminCreateUser with SUPPRESS for the MessageAction parameter, and Amazon Cognito won't send any email. In either case, the user will be in the FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD state until they sign in and change their password. AdminCreateUser requires developer credentials.
    func adminCreateUser(input: AdminCreateUserInput) async throws -> AdminCreateUserOutputResponse

If the user that you want to deactivate is a Amazon Cognito user pools native username + password user, they can't use their password to sign in. If the user to deactivate is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. When the external user signs in again, and the user is no longer attached to the previously linked DestinationUser, the user must create a new user account. See [AdminLinkProviderForUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminLinkProviderForUser.html). This action is enabled only for admin access and requires developer credentials. The ProviderName must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the pool. To deactivate a native username + password user, the ProviderName value must be Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject. The ProviderAttributeValue must be the name that is used in the user pool for the user. The ProviderAttributeName must always be Cognito_Subject for social IdPs. The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user. For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign in, the ProviderAttributeName and ProviderAttributeValue must be the same values that were used for the SourceUser when the identities were originally linked using  AdminLinkProviderForUser call. (If the linking was done with ProviderAttributeName set to Cognito_Subject, the same applies here). However, if the user has already signed in, the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject and ProviderAttributeValue must be the subject of the SAML assertion.

    /// Links an existing user account in a user pool (DestinationUser) to an identity from an external IdP (SourceUser) based on a specified attribute name and value from the external IdP. This allows you to create a link from the existing user account to an external federated user identity that has not yet been used to sign in. You can then use the federated user identity to sign in as the existing user account. For example, if there is an existing user with a username and password, this API links that user to a federated user identity. When the user signs in with a federated user identity, they sign in as the existing user account. The maximum number of federated identities linked to a user is five. Because this API allows a user with an external federated identity to sign in as an existing user in the user pool, it is critical that it only be used with external IdPs and provider attributes that have been trusted by the application owner.

If a user tries to sign in after the API is called, the app will get a PasswordResetRequiredException exception back and should direct the user down the flow to reset the password, which is the same as the forgot password flow. In addition, if the user pool has phone verification selected and a verified phone number exists for the user, or if email verification is selected and a verified email exists for the user, calling this API will also result in sending a message to the end user with the code to change their password.

For example, if you have two versions of a user pool, one for testing and another for production, you might assign an Environment tag key to both user pools. The value of this key might be Test for one user pool, and Production for the other. Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your tags so that they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where you can track the costs associated with your user pools. In an Identity and Access Management policy, you can constrain permissions for user pools based on specific tags or tag values. You can use this action up to 5 times per second, per account.

A custom domain is used to host the Amazon Cognito hosted UI, which provides sign-up and sign-in pages for your application. When you set up a custom domain, you provide a certificate that you manage with Certificate Manager (ACM). When necessary, you can use this operation to change the certificate that you applied to your custom domain. Usually, this is unnecessary following routine certificate renewal with ACM. When you renew your existing certificate in ACM, the ARN for your certificate remains the same, and your custom domain uses the new certificate automatically. However, if you replace your existing certificate with a new one, ACM gives the new certificate a new ARN. To apply the new certificate to your custom domain, you must provide this ARN to Amazon Cognito. When you add your new certificate in ACM, you must choose US East (N. Virginia) as the Amazon Web Services Region. After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your custom domain.
