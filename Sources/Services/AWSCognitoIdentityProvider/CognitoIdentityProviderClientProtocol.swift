/// With the Amazon Cognito user pools API, you can configure user pools and authenticate users. To authenticate users from third-party identity providers (IdPs) in this API, you can [link IdP users to native user profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation-consolidate-users.html). Learn more about the authentication and authorization of federated users at [Adding user pool sign-in through a third party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation.html) and in the [User pool federation endpoints and hosted UI reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html). This API reference provides detailed information about API operations and object types in Amazon Cognito. Along with resource management operations, the Amazon Cognito user pools API includes classes of operations and authorization models for client-side and server-side authentication of users. You can interact with operations in the Amazon Cognito user pools API as any of the following subjects.
///
/// * An administrator who wants to configure user pools, app clients, users, groups, or other user pool functions.
///
/// * A server-side app, like a web application, that wants to use its Amazon Web Services privileges to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.
///
/// * A client-side app, like a mobile app, that wants to make unauthenticated requests to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.
///
///
/// For more information, see [Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html) in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.

Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/). Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in. If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In [sandbox mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [ SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html) in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. This message is based on a template that you configured in your call to create or update a user pool. This template includes your custom sign-up instructions and placeholders for user name and temporary password. Alternatively, you can call AdminCreateUser with SUPPRESS for the MessageAction parameter, and Amazon Cognito won't send any email. In either case, the user will be in the FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD state until they sign in and change their password.

If the user that you want to deactivate is a Amazon Cognito user pools native username + password user, they can't use their password to sign in. If the user to deactivate is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. When the external user signs in again, and the user is no longer attached to the previously linked DestinationUser, the user must create a new user account. See [AdminLinkProviderForUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminLinkProviderForUser.html). The ProviderName must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the pool. To deactivate a native username + password user, the ProviderName value must be Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject. The ProviderAttributeValue must be the name that is used in the user pool for the user. The ProviderAttributeName must always be Cognito_Subject for social IdPs. The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user. For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign in, the ProviderAttributeName and ProviderAttributeValue must be the same values that were used for the SourceUser when the identities were originally linked using  AdminLinkProviderForUser call. (If the linking was done with ProviderAttributeName set to Cognito_Subject, the same applies here). However, if the user has already signed in, the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject and ProviderAttributeValue must be the subject of the SAML assertion.

You can then use the federated user identity to sign in as the existing user account.

When the user signs in with a federated user identity, they sign in as the existing user account. The maximum number of federated identities linked to a user is five. Because this API allows a user with an external federated identity to sign in as an existing user in the user pool, it is critical that it only be used with external IdPs and provider attributes that have been trusted by the application owner.

AdminSetUserPassword can set a password for the user profile that Amazon Cognito creates for third-party federated users. When you set a password, the federated user's status changes from EXTERNAL_PROVIDER to CONFIRMED. A user in this state can sign in as a federated user, and initiate authentication flows in the API like a linked native user. They can also modify their password and attributes in token-authenticated API requests like ChangePassword and UpdateUserAttributes. As a best security practice and to keep users in sync with your external IdP, don't set passwords on federated user profiles.

You can use this operation to provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a new certificate to Amazon Cognito. You can't use it to change the domain for a user pool. A custom domain is used to host the Amazon Cognito hosted UI, which provides sign-up and sign-in pages for your application. When you set up a custom domain, you provide a certificate that you manage with Certificate Manager (ACM). When necessary, you can use this operation to change the certificate that you applied to your custom domain. Usually, this is unnecessary following routine certificate renewal with ACM. When you renew your existing certificate in ACM, the ARN for your certificate remains the same, and your custom domain uses the new certificate automatically. However, if you replace your existing certificate with a new one, ACM gives the new certificate a new ARN. To apply the new certificate to your custom domain, you must provide this ARN to Amazon Cognito. When you add your new certificate in ACM, you must choose US East (N. Virginia) as the Amazon Web Services Region. After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your custom domain. For more information about adding a custom domain to your user pool, see [Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-add-custom-domain.html).
