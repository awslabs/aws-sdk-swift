/// Amazon Redshift Overview This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to [Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html). Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers. If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the [Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html). If you are a database developer, the [Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html) explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse.

    /// Adds an inbound (ingress) rule to an Amazon Redshift security group. Depending on whether the application accessing your cluster is running on the Internet or an Amazon EC2 instance, you can authorize inbound access to either a Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)/Internet Protocol (IP) range or to an Amazon EC2 security group. You can add as many as 20 ingress rules to an Amazon Redshift security group. If you authorize access to an Amazon EC2 security group, specify EC2SecurityGroupName and EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId. The Amazon EC2 security group and Amazon Redshift cluster must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region. If you authorize access to a CIDR/IP address range, specify CIDRIP. For an overview of CIDR blocks, see the Wikipedia article on [Classless Inter-Domain Routing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). You must also associate the security group with a cluster so that clients running on these IP addresses or the EC2 instance are authorized to connect to the cluster.
