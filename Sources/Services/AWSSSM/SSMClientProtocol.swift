    /// Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your automations, documents, managed nodes, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed nodes that helps you track each node's owner and stack level. For example:
    ///
    /// * Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin
    ///
    /// * Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin
    ///
    /// * Key=Owner,Value=Dev

    /// * Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production
    ///
    /// * Key=Stack,Value=Test
    ///
    ///
    /// Most resources can have a maximum of 50 tags. Automations can have a maximum of 5 tags. We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, see [Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when new managed nodes are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day.

    /// A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Amazon Web Services Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: SyncToDestination and SyncFromSource. You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the SyncToDestination type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. For more information, see [Configuring resource data sync for Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-datasync.html) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the SyncFromSource type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single Amazon S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple Amazon Web Services accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions or EntireOrganization by using Organizations. For more information, see [Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-resource-data-sync.html) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of a sync, use the [ListResourceDataSync]. By default, data isn't encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy.
