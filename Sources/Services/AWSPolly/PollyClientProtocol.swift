/// Amazon Polly is a web service that makes it easy to synthesize speech from text. The Amazon Polly service provides API operations for synthesizing high-quality speech from plain text and Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), along with managing pronunciations lexicons that enable you to get the best results for your application domain.

A lexicon which has been deleted is not available for speech synthesis, nor is it possible to retrieve it using either the GetLexicon or ListLexicon APIs.

    /// Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice name. When synthesizing speech ( SynthesizeSpeech ), you provide the voice ID for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by DescribeVoices. For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using the DescribeVoices operation you can provide the user with a list of available voices to select from. You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if you specify en-US, the operation returns a list of all available US English voices. This operation requires permissions to perform the polly:DescribeVoices action.

    /// Stores a pronunciation lexicon in an Amazon Web Services Region. If a lexicon with the same name already exists in the region, it is overwritten by the new lexicon.

This operation requires all the standard information needed for speech synthesis, plus the name of an Amazon S3 bucket for the service to store the output of the synthesis task and two optional parameters (OutputS3KeyPrefix and SnsTopicArn). Once the synthesis task is created, this operation will return a SpeechSynthesisTask object, which will include an identifier of this task as well as the current status. The SpeechSynthesisTask object is available for 72 hours after starting the asynchronous synthesis task.
