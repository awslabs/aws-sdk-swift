/// IoT IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources associated with each device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate devices. The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in [Amazon Web Services IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html). You must use the endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to access. The service name used by [Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) to sign the request is: execute-api. For more information about how IoT works, see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html). For information about how to use the credentials provider for IoT, see [Authorizing Direct Calls to Amazon Web Services Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorizing-direct-aws.html).

The CSR must include a public key that is either an RSA key with a length of at least 2048 bits or an ECC key from NIST P-256, NIST P-384, or NIST P-521 curves. For supported certificates, consult [ Certificate signing algorithms supported by IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-client-certs.html#x509-cert-algorithms). Reusing the same certificate signing request (CSR) results in a distinct certificate. You can create multiple certificates in a batch by creating a directory, copying multiple .csr files into that directory, and then specifying that directory on the command line. The following commands show how to create a batch of certificates given a batch of CSRs. In the following commands, we assume that a set of CSRs are located inside of the directory my-csr-directory: On Linux and OS X, the command is: $ ls my-csr-directory/ | xargs -I {} aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://my-csr-directory/{} This command lists all of the CSRs in my-csr-directory and pipes each CSR file name to the aws iot create-certificate-from-csr Amazon Web Services CLI command to create a certificate for the corresponding CSR. You can also run the aws iot create-certificate-from-csr part of the command in parallel to speed up the certificate creation process: $ ls my-csr-directory/ | xargs -P 10 -I {} aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://my-csr-directory/{}  On Windows PowerShell, the command to create certificates for all CSRs in my-csr-directory is: > ls -Name my-csr-directory | %{aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://my-csr-directory/$_}  On a Windows command prompt, the command to create certificates for all CSRs in my-csr-directory is: > forfiles /p my-csr-directory /c "cmd /c aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://@path"

For more information, see [Customizing certificate signing using Amazon Web Services IoT Core certificate provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/provisioning-cert-provider.html) from Amazon Web Services IoT Core Developer Guide. Requires permission to access the [CreateCertificateProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions) action. After you create a certificate provider, the behavior of [CreateCertificateFromCsr] API for fleet provisioning(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/fleet-provision-api.html#create-cert-csr) will change and all API calls to CreateCertificateFromCsr will invoke the certificate provider to create the certificates. It can take up to a few minutes for this behavior to change after a certificate provider is created.
