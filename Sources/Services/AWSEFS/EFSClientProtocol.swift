/// Amazon Elastic File System Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2 Linux and Mac instances in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so that your applications have the storage they need, when they need it. For more information, see the [Amazon Elastic File System API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html) and the [Amazon Elastic File System User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html).
public protocol EFSClientProtocol {
    /// Creates an EFS access point. An access point is an application-specific view into an EFS file system that applies an operating system user and group, and a file system path, to any file system request made through the access point. The operating system user and group override any identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is exposed as the access point's root directory. Applications using the access point can only access data in the application's own directory and any subdirectories. To learn more, see [Mounting a file system using EFS access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html). If multiple requests to create access points on the same file system are sent in quick succession, and the file system is near the limit of 1,000 access points, you may experience a throttling response for these requests. This is to ensure that the file system does not exceed the stated access point limit. This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint action. Access points can be tagged on creation. If tags are specified in the creation action, IAM performs additional authorization on the elasticfilesystem:TagResource action to verify if users have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the elasticfilesystem:TagResource action. For more information, see [Granting permissions to tag resources during creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/using-tags-efs.html#supported-iam-actions-tagging.html).

    /// Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's Amazon Web Services account with the specified creation token, this operation does the following:
    ///
    /// * Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state creating.
    ///
    /// * Returns with the description of the created file system.
    ///
    ///
    /// Otherwise, this operation returns a FileSystemAlreadyExists error with the ID of the existing file system. For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation token. The idempotent operation allows you to retry a CreateFileSystem call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of its existence from the FileSystemAlreadyExists error. For more information, see [Creating a file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/creating-using-create-fs.html#creating-using-create-fs-part1) in the Amazon EFS User Guide. The CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still creating. You can check the file system creation status by calling the [DescribeFileSystems] operation, which among other things returns the file system state. This operation accepts an optional PerformanceMode parameter that you choose for your file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created. For more information, see [Amazon EFS performance modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html). You can set the throughput mode for the file system using the ThroughputMode parameter. After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to available, at which point you can create one or more mount targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see [CreateMountTarget]. You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by using the mount target. For more information, see [Amazon EFS: How it Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html). This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem action. File systems can be tagged on creation. If tags are specified in the creation action, IAM performs additional authorization on the elasticfilesystem:TagResource action to verify if users have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the elasticfilesystem:TagResource action.

    /// Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system on EC2 instances by using the mount target. You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their file system. You can create only one mount target for an EFS file system using One Zone storage classes. You must create that mount target in the same Availability Zone in which the file system is located. Use the AvailabilityZoneName and AvailabiltyZoneId properties in the [DescribeFileSystems] response object to get this information. Use the subnetId associated with the file system's Availability Zone when creating the mount target. For more information, see [Amazon EFS: How it Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html). To create a mount target for a file system, the file system's lifecycle state must be available. For more information, see [DescribeFileSystems]. In the request, provide the following:
    ///
    /// * The file system ID for which you are creating the mount target.
    ///
    /// * A subnet ID, which determines the following:
    ///
    /// * The VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
    ///
    /// * The Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
    ///
    /// * The IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the mount target (if you don't specify an IP address in the request)
    ///
    ///
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a MountTargetId and an IpAddress. You use this IP address when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see [How it Works: Implementation Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation). Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must meet the following requirements:
    ///
    /// * Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets
    ///
    /// * Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the existing mount targets
    ///
    ///
    /// If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:
    ///
    /// * Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.
    ///
    /// * Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:
    ///
    /// * If the request provides an IpAddress, Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 CreateNetworkInterface call does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).
    ///
    /// * If the request provides SecurityGroups, this network interface is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security group for the subnet's VPC.
    ///
    /// * Assigns the description Mount target fsmt-id for file system fs-id  where  fsmt-id  is the mount target ID, and  fs-id  is the FileSystemId.
    ///
    /// * Sets the requesterManaged property of the network interface to true, and the requesterId value to EFS.
    ///
    ///
    /// Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the NetworkInterfaceId field in the mount target's description to the network interface ID, and the IpAddress field to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire CreateMountTarget operation fails.
    ///
    ///
    /// The CreateMountTarget call returns only after creating the network interface, but while the mount target state is still creating, you can check the mount target creation status by calling the [DescribeMountTargets] operation, which among other things returns the mount target state. We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone. For more information, see [Amazon EFS](http://aws.amazon.com/efs/). In addition, by always using a mount target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount target is created goes down, then you can't access your file system through that mount target.
