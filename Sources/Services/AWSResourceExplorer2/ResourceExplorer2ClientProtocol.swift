/// Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and discovery service. By using Resource Explorer, you can explore your resources using an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of resources include Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon DynamoDB tables. You can search for your resources using resource metadata like names, tags, and IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your account in which you turn the service on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads. Resource Explorer scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your Amazon Web Services account in which you turn on Resource Explorer. Resource Explorer [creates and maintains an index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index) in each Region, with the details of that Region's resources. You can [search across all of the indexed Regions in your account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html) by designating one of your Amazon Web Services Regions to contain the aggregator index for the account. When you [promote a local index in a Region to become the aggregator index for the account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html), Resource Explorer automatically replicates the index information from all local indexes in the other Regions to the aggregator index. Therefore, the Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all resource information for all Regions in the account where you turned on Resource Explorer. As a result, views in the aggregator index Region include resources from all of the indexed Regions in your account. For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer, including how to enable and configure the service, see the [Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/).

    /// Turns on Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation by creating an index. Resource Explorer begins discovering the resources in this Region and stores the details about the resources in the index so that they can be queried by using the [Search] operation. You can create only one index in a Region. This operation creates only a local index. To promote the local index in one Amazon Web Services Region into the aggregator index for the Amazon Web Services account, use the [UpdateIndexType] operation. For more information, see [Turning on cross-Region search by creating an aggregator index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html) in the Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide. For more details about what happens when you turn on Resource Explorer in an Amazon Web Services Region, see [Turn on Resource Explorer to index your resources in an Amazon Web Services Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-service-activate.html) in the Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide. If this is the first Amazon Web Services Region in which you've created an index for Resource Explorer, then this operation also [creates a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-linked-roles.html) in your Amazon Web Services account that allows Resource Explorer to enumerate your resources to populate the index.

For example, the following Resource element restricts the role or user to creating an index in only the us-east-2 Region of the specified account. "Resource": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:<account-id>:index/*" Alternatively, you can use "Resource": "*" to allow the role or user to create an index in any Region.

After you demote an aggregator index to a local index, you must wait 24 hours before you can promote another index to be the new aggregator index for the account.
