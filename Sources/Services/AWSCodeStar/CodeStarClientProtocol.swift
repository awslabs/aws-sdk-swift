///
/// * ListProjects, which lists all projects associated with your AWS account.
///
/// * ListResources, which lists the resources associated with a project.
///
/// * ListTagsForProject, which lists the tags associated with a project.
///
/// * TagProject, which adds tags to a project.
///
/// * UntagProject, which removes tags from a project.
///
/// * UpdateProject, which updates the attributes of a project.
///
///
/// Teams and team members, by calling the following:
///
/// * AssociateTeamMember, which adds an IAM user to the team for a project.
///
/// * DisassociateTeamMember, which removes an IAM user from the team for a project.
///
/// * ListTeamMembers, which lists all the IAM users in the team for a project, including their roles and attributes.
///
/// * UpdateTeamMember, which updates a team member's attributes in a project.
///

/// Users, by calling the following:
///
/// * CreateUserProfile, which creates a user profile that contains data associated with the user across all projects.
///
/// * DeleteUserProfile, which deletes all user profile information across all projects.
///
/// * DescribeUserProfile, which describes the profile of a user.
///
/// * ListUserProfiles, which lists all user profiles.
///
/// * UpdateUserProfile, which updates the profile for a user.
