    /// * Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII.

    ///
    /// Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the SendRawEmail operation:
    ///
    /// * Although you can customize the message headers when using the SendRawEmail operation, Amazon SES automatically applies its own Message-ID and Date headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they are overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.
    ///
    /// * If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, SendRawEmail enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters SourceArn, FromArn, and/or ReturnPathArn, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:
    ///
    /// * X-SES-SOURCE-ARN
    ///
    /// * X-SES-FROM-ARN
    ///
    /// * X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN
    ///
    ///
    /// Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email. If you only specify the SourceIdentityArn parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified. For more information about sending authorization, see the [Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html) in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.
