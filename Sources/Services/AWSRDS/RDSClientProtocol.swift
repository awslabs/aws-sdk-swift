/// Amazon Relational Database Service Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique. Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use. This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide. Amazon RDS API Reference

    /// Creates a new DB cluster parameter group. Parameters in a DB cluster parameter group apply to all of the instances in a DB cluster. A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by instances in the DB cluster. To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup. Once you've created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using ModifyDBCluster. When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running Aurora DB cluster, reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect. When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running Multi-AZ DB cluster, reboot the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect. After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter. You can use the Parameter Groups option of the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) or the DescribeDBClusterParameters operation to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.

To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using ModifyDBParameterGroup. Once you've created a DB parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB instance using ModifyDBInstance. When you associate a new DB parameter group with a running DB instance, you need to reboot the DB instance without failover for the new DB parameter group and associated settings to take effect. This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom. After you create a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter. You can use the Parameter Groups option of the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) or the DescribeDBParameters command to verify that your DB parameter group has been created or modified.

A maximum of 20 parameters can be modified in a single request. After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter.
