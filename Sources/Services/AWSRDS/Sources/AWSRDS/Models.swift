    /// * DestinationRegion - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted DB snapshot is copied to. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the CopyDBSnapshot operation is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the CopyDBSnapshot operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CopyDBSnapshot operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.
    ///
    /// * KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBSnapshot operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.
    ///
    /// * SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier - The DB snapshot identifier for the encrypted snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20161115.

If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually.

This setting is required for RDS Custom for Oracle. The CEV name has the following format: 19.customized_string. A valid CEV name is 19.my_cev1. For more information, see [ Creating an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-creating.html#custom-creating.create) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server See [RDS Custom for SQL Server general requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-reqs-limits-MS.html) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. RDS for Db2 For information, see [Db2 on Amazon RDS versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Db2.html#Db2.Concepts.VersionMgmt) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. RDS for MariaDB For information, see [MariaDB on Amazon RDS versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MariaDB.html#MariaDB.Concepts.VersionMgmt) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. RDS for Microsoft SQL Server For information, see [Microsoft SQL Server versions on Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.VersionSupport) in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

For information about valid IOPS values, see [Amazon RDS DB instance storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html) in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is managed by the DB cluster. Constraints:

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see CreateDBCluster. If StorageEncrypted is enabled, and you do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. For Amazon RDS Custom, a KMS key is required for DB instances. For most RDS engines, if you leave this parameter empty while enabling StorageEncrypted, the engine uses the default KMS key. However, RDS Custom doesn't use the default key when this parameter is empty. You must explicitly specify a key.
