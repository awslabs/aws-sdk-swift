/// Amazon Web Services Price List API is a centralized and convenient way to programmatically query Amazon Web Services for services, products, and pricing information. The Amazon Web Services Price List uses standardized product attributes such as Location, Storage Class, and Operating System, and provides prices at the SKU level. You can use the Amazon Web Services Price List to build cost control and scenario planning tools, reconcile billing data, forecast future spend for budgeting purposes, and provide cost benefit analysis that compare your internal workloads with Amazon Web Services. Use GetServices without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all AWS services, then GetServices with a service code to retrieve the attribute names for that service. After you have the service code and attribute names, you can use GetAttributeValues to see what values are available for an attribute. With the service code and an attribute name and value, you can use GetProducts to find specific products that you're interested in, such as an AmazonEC2 instance, with a Provisioned IOPSvolumeType. Service Endpoint Amazon Web Services Price List service API provides the following two endpoints:
///
/// * https://api.pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
///
/// * https://api.pricing.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
public protocol PricingClientProtocol {
    /// Returns the metadata for one service or a list of the metadata for all services. Use this without a service code to get the service codes for all services. Use it with a service code, such as AmazonEC2, to get information specific to that service, such as the attribute names available for that service. For example, some of the attribute names available for EC2 are volumeType, maxIopsVolume, operation, locationType, and instanceCapacity10xlarge.
    func describeServices(input: DescribeServicesInput) async throws -> DescribeServicesOutputResponse
    /// Returns a list of attribute values. Attributes are similar to the details in a Price List API offer file. For a list of available attributes, see [Offer File Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/reading-an-offer.html#pps-defs) in the [Billing and Cost Management User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-what-is.html).
    func getAttributeValues(input: GetAttributeValuesInput) async throws -> GetAttributeValuesOutputResponse
    /// Returns a list of all products that match the filter criteria.
    func getProducts(input: GetProductsInput) async throws -> GetProductsOutputResponse
