/// Config Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the Amazon Web Services resources associated with your Amazon Web Services account. You can use Config to get the current and historical configurations of each Amazon Web Services resource and also to get information about the relationship between the resources. An Amazon Web Services resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of resources currently supported by Config, see [Supported Amazon Web Services resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources). You can access and manage Config through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), the Config API, or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for Config. This reference guide contains documentation for the Config API and the Amazon Web Services CLI commands that you can use to manage Config. The Config API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). For detailed information about Config features and their associated actions or commands, as well as how to work with Amazon Web Services Management Console, see [What Is Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html) in the Config Developer Guide.

    /// Adds or updates an Config rule to evaluate if your Amazon Web Services resources comply with your desired configurations. For information on how many Config rules you can have per account, see [ Service Limits ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/configlimits.html) in the Config Developer Guide. There are two types of rules: Config Managed Rules and Config Custom Rules. You can use PutConfigRule to create both Config Managed Rules and Config Custom Rules. Config Managed Rules are predefined, customizable rules created by Config. For a list of managed rules, see [List of Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html). If you are adding an Config managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier for the SourceIdentifier key. Config Custom Rules are rules that you create from scratch. There are two ways to create Config custom rules: with Lambda functions ([ Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-function)) and with Guard ([Guard GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard)), a policy-as-code language. Config custom rules created with Lambda are called Config Custom Lambda Rules and Config custom rules created with Guard are called Config Custom Policy Rules. If you are adding a new Config Custom Lambda rule, you first need to create an Lambda function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use PutConfigRule to add a Custom Lambda rule to Config, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the function. You specify the ARN in the SourceIdentifier key. This key is part of the Source object, which is part of the ConfigRule object. For any new Config rule that you add, specify the ConfigRuleName in the ConfigRule object. Do not specify the ConfigRuleArn or the ConfigRuleId. These values are generated by Config for new rules. If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule by ConfigRuleName, ConfigRuleId, or ConfigRuleArn in the ConfigRule data type that you use in this request. For more information about developing and using Config rules, see [Evaluating Resources with Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html) in the Config Developer Guide. PutConfigRule is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if one was already created. If a following request has different tags values, Config will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, tags will not be updated, even if they are different.

Only a management account and a delegated administrator can create or update an organization Config rule. When calling this API with a delegated administrator, you must ensure Organizations ListDelegatedAdministrator permissions are added. An organization can have up to 3 delegated administrators. This API enables organization service access through the EnableAWSServiceAccess action and creates a service-linked role AWSServiceRoleForConfigMultiAccountSetup in the management or delegated administrator account of your organization. The service-linked role is created only when the role does not exist in the caller account. Config verifies the existence of role with GetRole action. To use this API with delegated administrator, register a delegated administrator by calling Amazon Web Services Organization register-delegated-administrator for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com.

Config custom rules created with Lambda are called Config Custom Lambda Rules and Config custom rules created with Guard are called Config Custom Policy Rules. If you are adding a new Config Custom Lambda rule, you first need to create an Lambda function in the management account or a delegated administrator that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. You also need to create an IAM role in the managed account that can be assumed by the Lambda function. When you use PutOrganizationConfigRule to add a Custom Lambda rule to Config, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the function. Prerequisite: Ensure you call EnableAllFeatures API to enable all features in an organization. Make sure to specify one of either OrganizationCustomPolicyRuleMetadata for Custom Policy rules, OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata for Custom Lambda rules, or OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata for managed rules.

    /// A remediation exception is when a specified resource is no longer considered for auto-remediation. This API adds a new exception or updates an existing exception for a specified resource with a specified Config rule. Config generates a remediation exception when a problem occurs running a remediation action for a specified resource. Remediation exceptions blocks auto-remediation until the exception is cleared. When placing an exception on an Amazon Web Services resource, it is recommended that remediation is set as manual remediation until the given Config rule for the specified resource evaluates the resource as NON_COMPLIANT. Once the resource has been evaluated as NON_COMPLIANT, you can add remediation exceptions and change the remediation type back from Manual to Auto if you want to use auto-remediation. Otherwise, using auto-remediation before a NON_COMPLIANT evaluation result can delete resources before the exception is applied. Placing an exception can only be performed on resources that are NON_COMPLIANT. If you use this API for COMPLIANT resources or resources that are NOT_APPLICABLE, a remediation exception will not be generated.
