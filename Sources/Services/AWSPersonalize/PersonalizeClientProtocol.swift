Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling A high minProvisionedTPS will increase your bill. We recommend starting with 1 for minProvisionedTPS (the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary. A transaction is a single GetRecommendations or GetPersonalizedRanking call. Transactions per second (TPS) is the throughput and unit of billing for Amazon Personalize. The minimum provisioned TPS (minProvisionedTPS) specifies the baseline throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize, and thus, the minimum billing charge. If your TPS increases beyond minProvisionedTPS, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below minProvisionedTPS. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. The actual TPS used is calculated as the average requests/second within a 5-minute window. You pay for maximum of either the minimum provisioned TPS or the actual TPS. We recommend starting with a low minProvisionedTPS, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary.
