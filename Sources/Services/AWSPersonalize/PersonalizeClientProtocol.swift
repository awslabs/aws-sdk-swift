To generate batch recommendations, specify the ARN of a solution version and an Amazon S3 URI for the input and output data. For user personalization, popular items, and personalized ranking solutions, the batch inference job generates a list of recommended items for each user ID in the input file. For related items solutions, the job generates a list of recommended items for each item ID in the input file. For more information, see [Creating a batch inference job ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/getting-batch-recommendations.html). If you use the Similar-Items recipe, Amazon Personalize can add descriptive themes to batch recommendations. To generate themes, set the job's mode to THEME_GENERATION and specify the name of the field that contains item names in the input data. For more information about generating themes, see [Batch recommendations with themes from Content Generator ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/themed-batch-recommendations.html). You can't get batch recommendations with the Trending-Now or Next-Best-Action recipes.

Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling A high minProvisionedTPS will increase your bill. We recommend starting with 1 for minProvisionedTPS (the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary. A transaction is a single GetRecommendations or GetPersonalizedRanking call. Transactions per second (TPS) is the throughput and unit of billing for Amazon Personalize. The minimum provisioned TPS (minProvisionedTPS) specifies the baseline throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize, and thus, the minimum billing charge. If your TPS increases beyond minProvisionedTPS, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below minProvisionedTPS. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. The actual TPS used is calculated as the average requests/second within a 5-minute window. You pay for maximum of either the minimum provisioned TPS or the actual TPS. We recommend starting with a low minProvisionedTPS, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary.

    /// Creates the configuration for training a model. A trained model is known as a solution version. After the configuration is created, you train the model (create a solution version) by calling the [CreateSolutionVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateSolutionVersion.html) operation. Every time you call CreateSolutionVersion, a new version of the solution is created. After creating a solution version, you check its accuracy by calling [GetSolutionMetrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_GetSolutionMetrics.html). When you are satisfied with the version, you deploy it using [CreateCampaign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateCampaign.html). The campaign provides recommendations to a client through the [GetRecommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html) API. To train a model, Amazon Personalize requires training data and a recipe. The training data comes from the dataset group that you provide in the request. A recipe specifies the training algorithm and a feature transformation. You can specify one of the predefined recipes provided by Amazon Personalize.
