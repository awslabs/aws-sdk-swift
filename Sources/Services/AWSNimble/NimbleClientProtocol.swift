    /// Create a new studio. When creating a studio, two IAM roles must be provided: the admin role and the user role. These roles are assumed by your users when they log in to the Nimble Studio portal. The user role must have the AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioUser managed policy attached for the portal to function properly. The admin role must have the AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioAdmin managed policy attached for the portal to function properly. You may optionally specify a KMS key in the StudioEncryptionConfiguration. In Nimble Studio, resource names, descriptions, initialization scripts, and other data you provide are always encrypted at rest using an KMS key. By default, this key is owned by Amazon Web Services and managed on your behalf. You may provide your own KMS key when calling CreateStudio to encrypt this data using a key you own and manage. When providing an KMS key during studio creation, Nimble Studio creates KMS grants in your account to provide your studio user and admin roles access to these KMS keys. If you delete this grant, the studio will no longer be accessible to your portal users. If you delete the studio KMS key, your studio will no longer be accessible.
