/// Lambda Overview Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. For more information about the Lambda service, see [What is Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) in the Lambda Developer Guide. The Lambda API Reference provides information about each of the API methods, including details about the parameters in each API request and response. You can use Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For installation instructions, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). For a list of Region-specific endpoints that Lambda supports, see [Lambda endpoints and quotas ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html/) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.. When making the API calls, you will need to authenticate your request by providing a signature. Lambda supports signature version 4. For more information, see [Signature Version 4 signing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.. CA certificates Because Amazon Web Services SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your computer's CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the update process. The following list shows minimum operating system and Java versions:
///
/// * Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later installed contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list.
///
/// * Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and later versions contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list.
///
/// * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and CentOS 5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list.
///
/// * Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6 (December 2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list.
///
///
/// When accessing the Lambda management console or Lambda API endpoints, whether through browsers or programmatically, you will need to ensure your client machines support any of the following CAs:
///
/// * Amazon Root CA 1
///
/// * Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2
///
/// * Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority
///
///
/// Root certificates from the first two authorities are available from [Amazon trust services](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/), but keeping your computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution. To learn more about ACM-provided certificates, see [Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager FAQs.](http://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/faqs/#certificates)

To grant permission to another account, specify the account ID as the Principal. To grant permission to an organization defined in Organizations, specify the organization ID as the PrincipalOrgID. For Amazon Web Services, the principal is a domain-style identifier that the service defines, such as s3.amazonaws.com or sns.amazonaws.com. For Amazon Web Services, you can also specify the ARN of the associated resource as the SourceArn. If you grant permission to a service principal without specifying the source, other accounts could potentially configure resources in their account to invoke your Lambda function. This operation adds a statement to a resource-based permissions policy for the function.

    func createEventSourceMapping(input: CreateEventSourceMappingInput) async throws -> CreateEventSourceMappingOutputResponse
    /// Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a [deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html) and an [execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role). The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray for request tracing. If the deployment package is a [container image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html), then you set the package type to Image. For a container image, the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry. You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties. If the deployment package is a [.zip file archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip), then you set the package type to Zip. For a .zip file archive, the code property specifies the location of the .zip file. You must also specify the handler and runtime properties. The code in the deployment package must be compatible with the target instruction set architecture of the function (x86-64 or arm64). If you do not specify the architecture, then the default value is x86-64. When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The State, StateReason, and StateReasonCode fields in the response from [GetFunctionConfiguration] indicate when the function is ready to invoke. For more information, see [Lambda function states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html). A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the Publish parameter to create version 1 of your function from its initial configuration. The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with [UpdateFunctionConfiguration]. Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include tags ([TagResource]) and per-function concurrency limits ([PutFunctionConcurrency]). You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with [UpdateFunctionCode], Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function. If another Amazon Web Services account or an Amazon Web Service invokes your function, use [AddPermission] to grant permission by creating a resource-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias. To invoke your function directly, use [Invoke]. To invoke your function in response to events in other Amazon Web Services, create an event source mapping ([CreateEventSourceMapping]), or configure a function trigger in the other service. For more information, see [Invoking Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-invocation.html).

    /// Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and wait for the response), or asynchronously. To invoke a function asynchronously, set InvocationType to Event. For [synchronous invocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-sync.html), details about the function response, including errors, are included in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find more information in the [execution log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html) and [trace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html). When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For more information, see [Error handling and automatic retries in Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-retries.html). For [asynchronous invocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html), Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function. If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue, events may be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same event multiple times, even if no error occurs. To retain events that were not processed, configure your function with a [dead-letter queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq). The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors. Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions errors, [quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html) errors, or issues with your function's code and configuration. For example, Lambda returns TooManyRequestsException if running the function would cause you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded) or function level (ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded). For functions with a long timeout, your client might disconnect during synchronous invocation while it waits for a response. Configure your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating system to allow for long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings. This operation requires permission for the [lambda:InvokeFunction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awslambda.html) action. For details on how to set up permissions for cross-account invocations, see [Granting function access to other accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html#permissions-resource-xaccountinvoke).

    /// Updates a Lambda function's code. If code signing is enabled for the function, the code package must be signed by a trusted publisher. For more information, see [Configuring code signing for Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-codesigning.html). If the function's package type is Image, then you must specify the code package in ImageUri as the URI of a [container image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html) in the Amazon ECR registry. If the function's package type is Zip, then you must specify the deployment package as a [.zip file archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip). Enter the Amazon S3 bucket and key of the code .zip file location. You can also provide the function code inline using the ZipFile field. The code in the deployment package must be compatible with the target instruction set architecture of the function (x86-64 or arm64). The function's code is locked when you publish a version. You can't modify the code of a published version, only the unpublished version. For a function defined as a container image, Lambda resolves the image tag to an image digest. In Amazon ECR, if you update the image tag to a new image, Lambda does not automatically update the function.

The LastUpdateStatus, LastUpdateStatusReason, and LastUpdateStatusReasonCode fields in the response from [GetFunctionConfiguration] indicate when the update is complete and the function is processing events with the new configuration. For more information, see [Lambda function states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html). These settings can vary between versions of a function and are locked when you publish a version. You can't modify the configuration of a published version, only the unpublished version.
