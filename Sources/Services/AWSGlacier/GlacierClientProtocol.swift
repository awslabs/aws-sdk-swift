/// Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for "cold data." Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations. Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and your data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in Glacier. If you are a first-time user of Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide:
///
/// * [What is Amazon S3 Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html) - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.
///
/// * [Getting Started with Amazon S3 Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html) - The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.

    /// This operation aborts a multipart upload identified by the upload ID. After the Abort Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot upload any more parts to the multipart upload or complete the multipart upload. Aborting a completed upload fails. However, aborting an already-aborted upload will succeed, for a short time. For more information about uploading a part and completing a multipart upload, see [UploadMultipartPart] and [CompleteMultipartUpload]. This operation is idempotent. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

    /// You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see [InitiateJob]. In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html). On the server side, Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The [ListParts] operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue. Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier returns an error and the operation fails. Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.

    /// This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon S3 Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see [UploadMultipartPart]). When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB. Every part you upload to this resource (see [UploadMultipartPart]), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB. You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size. After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default.

The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation time. Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists. The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response Marker field. If there are no more jobs to list, the Marker field is set to null. If there are more jobs to list, the Marker field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the marker request parameter to the Marker value for that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request. You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by specifying the limit parameter in the request. The default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit. Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional statuscode parameter or completed parameter, or both. Using the statuscode parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match either the InProgress, Succeeded, or Failed status. Using the completed parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were completed (true) or jobs that were not completed (false).

    /// This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous operation, and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Amazon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID in the x-amz-archive-id header of the response. You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon S3 Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see [InitiateJob]. You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html). You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see [InitiateJob]. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list. Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description.

    /// This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload archive parts in any order. You can also upload them in parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload. Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:
    ///
    /// * SHA256 tree hash does not matchTo ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon S3 Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don't match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html).
    ///
    /// * Part size does not matchThe size of each part except the last must match the size specified in the corresponding [InitiateMultipartUpload] request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size. If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.
    ///
    /// * Range does not alignThe byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.
