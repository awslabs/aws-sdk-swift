Creates an uninitialized HSM instance. There is an upfront fee charged for each HSM instance that you create with the CreateHsm operation. If you accidentally provision an HSM and want to request a refund, delete the instance using the [DeleteHsm] operation, go to the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home), create a new case, and select Account and Billing Support. It can take up to 20 minutes to create and provision an HSM. You can monitor the status of the HSM with the [DescribeHsm] operation. The HSM is ready to be initialized when the status changes to RUNNING.
