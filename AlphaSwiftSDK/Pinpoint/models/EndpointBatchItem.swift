For a push-notification channel, use the token provided by the push notification service, such as an Apple Push Notification service (APNs) device token or a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) registration token. For the SMS channel, use a phone number in E.164 format, such as +12065550100. For the email channel, use an email address.</p>

For example, the value of a custom attribute named Interests might be: ["Science", "Music", "Travel"]. You can use these attributes as filter criteria when you create segments. Attribute names are case sensitive.</p> <p>An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters. An attribute value can contain up to 100 characters. When you define the name of a custom attribute, avoid using the following characters: number sign (#), colon (:), question mark (?), backslash (\), and slash (/).
