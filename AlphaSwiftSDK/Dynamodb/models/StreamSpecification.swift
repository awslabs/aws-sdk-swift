                   When an item in the table is modified, <code>StreamViewType</code>
                   determines what information is written to the stream for this table. Valid values for
                 <code>StreamViewType</code> are:</p>
                 <ul>
                 <li>
                       <p>
                          <code>KEYS_ONLY</code> - Only the key attributes of the modified item are written to the stream.</p>
                    </li>
                 <li>
                       <p>
                          <code>NEW_IMAGE</code> - The entire item, as it appears after it was modified, is written
                   to the stream.</p>
                    </li>
                 <li>
                       <p>
                          <code>OLD_IMAGE</code> - The entire item, as it appeared before it was modified, is
                   written to the stream.</p>
                    </li>
                 <li>
                       <p>
                          <code>NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES</code> - Both the new and the old item images of the item are
                   written to the stream.</p>
                    </li>
