public struct RestoreSecretInput: Equatable {
    /**
     <p>Specifies the secret that you want to restore from a previously scheduled deletion. You
           can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.</p>
              <note>
                 <p>If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can
             specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random
             characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN
             match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a
             name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six
             characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause
             Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected
             results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending
             with a hyphen followed by six characters.</p>
                 <p>If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the
             'friendly name', you <i>must</i> not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager,
             you receive either a <i>ResourceNotFoundException</i> or an <i>AccessDeniedException</i> error, depending on your permissions.</p>
