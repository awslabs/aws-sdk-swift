                 configuration set is applied to an email by including a reference to the configuration

                         click, bounce, and complaint events for each email sent. Use event publishing to
                         send information about these events to other AWS services such as SNS and

                             environments, the default email limit is below the required delivery volume.

                             configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to send email
                             from your verified email address. When you use this option, the email
                             delivery limits are the same limits that apply to your Amazon SES verified

                         <p>Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires additional
                             permissions to call Amazon SES on your behalf. When you update your user
                             pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a <i>service-linked
                                 role</i>, which is a type of IAM role, in your AWS account. This
                             role contains the permissions that allow Amazon Cognito to access Amazon SES
                             and send email messages with your address. For more information about the
                             service-linked role that Amazon Cognito creates, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html">Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon
