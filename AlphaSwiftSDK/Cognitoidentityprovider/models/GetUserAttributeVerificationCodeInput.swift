             <p>You create custom workflows by assigning AWS Lambda functions to user pool triggers.
                 When you use the GetUserAttributeVerificationCode API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the
                 function that is assigned to the <i>custom message</i> trigger. When
                 Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function
                 receives as input. This payload contains a <code>clientMetadata</code> attribute, which
                 provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your
                 GetUserAttributeVerificationCode request. In your function code in AWS Lambda, you can
                 process the <code>clientMetadata</code> value to enhance your workflow for your specific
                 needs.</p>
             <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html">Customizing User Pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers</a> in the
                     <i>Amazon Cognito Developer Guide</i>.</p>
             <note>
                 <p>Take the following limitations into consideration when you use the ClientMetadata
                     parameter:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>
                         <p>Amazon Cognito does not store the ClientMetadata value. This data is
                             available only to AWS Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to
                             support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration does not include
                             triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.</p>
                     </li>
                    <li>
                         <p>Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.</p>
                     </li>
                    <li>
                         <p>Amazon Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata value, so don't use
                             it to provide sensitive information.</p>
                     </li>
